# Maintain Dynamic Variables

Explanations of how Dynamic Variables may be used are offered above. There are also references to using Dynamic Variables within the description of many of the LSAM functions documented in other topics.

The fields available in the menu function are mostly the same as the fields available for use in the SETDYNVAR command (documented above, in this topic).

### LSAVARR1 - Work with Dynamic Variables

#### Menu Pathways

Main Menu > Job track menu (#1) > Maintain dynamic variables (#6)

Many of the LSAM menus support access to this function, since it is used everywhere among the Agent automation tools.

#### Options

- **2=Change**: Select a record for update. Press <**Enter**> to continue to the individual record maintenance screen.
- **3=Copy**: Select a record to copy into a new dynamic variable. Press <**Enter**> to continue to the Copy record screen where all the record fields, including the key values, may be updated, starting with the values from the original record.
- **4=Delete**: Select a dynamic variable to be added to a pending list of records to be deleted. When <**Enter**> is pressed, all records select with option 4 will appear on a confirmation list before records are actually deleted.
- **5=Display**: View the details of a dynamic variable.
- **6-DSPDYNVAR(V)**: Option 6 executes the LSAM testing command called DSPDYNVAR (display dynamic variable value). This option only works on Dynamic Variables of type V; it cannot be used on variables of type L. The current value of the Dynamic Variable appears in a completion message at the bottom of the screen, along with the date of last update. The value is formatted according to the current rules, making this a useful way to prove that master record formatting options are producing the desired result.

#### Fields
- **Search content**: Type in a value that can be found anywhere in the record represented by each line on the list. The entire record will be searched, not just the fields displayed in the list. Use option 5=Display to see the matching detail that satisfied the search when the cursor appears in the Opt field next to a line on the display. The <**Enter**> key or <**F16**> may be used to start a search, and <**F16**> is used to continue the search from the last record found.
- **Variable Name**:  The key identifier of each record. For records of type L, this name must be the Captured Job ID or the Job Name of a tracked or queued job. For records of type V, this may be any meaningful name that will be used to create a token ID. Job names are limited to 10 characters (which limits the Captured Job ID used as a variable name), but a variable names can use up to the 12 characters allowed for this field.
- **Seq**: This record sequence number may be zeros for records of type V because it has no meaning for this record type. For records of type L, this sequence number is used to create unique records keys when there is more than one dynamic variable assigned to the same Variable Name (there may be multiple updates specified for the LDA content of a single job).
- **T (Type)**: The record type is L for a dynamic variable that will be used to update the LDA content of a job. Type V records are dynamic variable tokens that can be inserted into job parameters or the job's call command line.
- **Description**: Any text used to describe the dynamic variable. This text is useful mostly for this list of variables, so that each can be easily identified. When the command SETDYNVAR is used to add a new dynamic variable automatically during some automated process, the Description will be the IBM i job ID (number/user/name) of the job that executed the SETDYNVAR command...unless the DESC( ) parameter is included within the command string.

#### Functions

- **F3=Exit**: Quits the list display and returns to the menu.
- **F5=Refresh**: Reload the list display with data from the master file.
- **F6=Add**: Branches to the display where a new dynamic variable master record is defined.
- **F8=DynVar**: Brings up a list of available Dynamic Variable names that can be selected and inserted into the VALUE field. These will be inserted using the {TOKEN} format.
- **F12=Cancel**: Quits the list display and returns to the Job Track Log Detail summary display.
- **F16=Search next**: Press to start a new search based on the value entered in the Search input field, or to continue a search from the last record found.
- **F17=Top**: Causes the list to display from the first record. The list is sorted in order of the Variable Name and Sequence within name.
- **F18=Bottom**: Causes the list to display the last record in the file.

## F6 = Add (Create) Dynamic Variable

### LSAVARR5 - Create Dynamic Variable

#### Menu Pathways

Main Menu > Job track menu (#1) > Maintain dynamic variables (#6) > F6=Add

Main Menu > Events and Utilities menu (#3) > Maintain dynamic variables (#6) > F6=Add

#### Fields

The variable name cannot be changed when the screen format is shown in Change mode, but the sequence number may be changed. The original sequence number shows at the top of the Change screen, and a new value may be specified in the Sequence number input field on the first line of record details.

| Field          | Values         | Default        | Description    |
| -----          | ------         | -------        | -----------    |
| Variable name  | Any characters | Â               | The key identifier of each record. For records of type L, this name must be the Captured Job ID or the Job Name of a tracked or queued job. For records of type V, this may be any meaningful name that will be used to create a token ID. Job names are limited to 10 characters, but a Captured Job ID or token ID can use up to the 12 characters allowed for this field.|
| Sequence number | 000 -- 999     | 000            | This record sequence number should be zeros for records of type V because it has no meaning for this record type. For records of type L, this sequence number is used to created unique records keys when there is more than one dynamic variable assigned to the same Variable Name (there may be multiple updates specified for the LDA content of a single job).  |
| Variable type  | L, V           | V              | The record type is L for a dynamic variable that will be used to update the LDA content of a job. Type V records are dynamic variable tokens that can be inserted into job parameters or the job's call command line.|
| LDA pos start (start position in LDA)  | 0 -- 1024      | 0000           | Required for record type L, not valid for type V. This  number specifies the cardinal position (1-1024) where substitution of the dynamic variable's value will begin in the image of the local data area (LDA) content for a job.   |
| LDA pos length (Length of LDA update) | 0 -- 1024      | 0000           | Required for record type L, not valid for type V. This number specifies how many characters in the LDA content image will be updated by the value of the dynamic variable. If the supplied variable value is longer than this length, the value will be truncated to this length. If the value is shorter than this length, the remaining length will be padded with space characters (blanks).   |
| Value calc program | A valid IBM i  | Blanks         | The name of an optional IBM i program supplied by the user that will calculate the dynamic variable's value at the moment just before the actual substitution will take place. The LSAM supports any length character string up to 128 characters in length. The content of this character string is not limited, since a local data area may contain any hexadecimal value in any position. |
|                    |                |                | **Note**: The LSAM passes the current value of the variable to the program, but uses whatever value is returned by the program to replace a variable token at run time. There is also a second parameter of 12 characters passed to the program that contains the Variable Name. |
| Value calc Lib | A valid IBM i library name  | Blanks         | The DB2/400 (DB2 UDB) library name where the userdefined value calculate program is found. |
| Description    | Any printable character text | IBM i job ID, when the SETDYNVAR command was used and the DESC keyword is not specified. | IBM i job ID, when the SETDYNVAR command was used and the DESC keyword is not specified.  | 
| Current/default value | Any keyboard character | Blanks         | To specify a fixed value for a dynamic variable, when a value calculate program is not being used, type in the value. If the required value cannot be typed on a workstation keyboard, then a value calculate program must be used to supply the value at run time. If a value calculate program is specified, but the program cannot be found at run time, then any value specified in this field will be used as the default. However, if a value calculate program is found, and the program returns blanks, then blanks will be used for the variable value. For type V tokens, a blank value will cause the token to be removed from the string where it was found and the string will be compressed to remove as many spaces as were occupied by the token. For type L variables, a final result of blanks for the variable will cause the LDA to be updated with space characters in the specified location/length. |
| Numeric field size | 0 - 63         | 0              | A non-zero value in this field designates that the dynamic variable will always be handled as a numeric field, capable of numeric operations and also optionally subject to numeric edit codes to prepare the value for output when it is requested. |
| Numeric field dec | 0 - 63         | 0              | A non-zero value in this field specifies the number of digits (included in the total size value, above) that are handled as right of the decimal point, that is, part of the numeric value that is less than 1, such as tenths, hundredths, etc. This field only applies if the size field is also not zero. The number of decimals cannot exceed the total
numeric field size.  |
| Decimal point symbol | any            | . (period)     | When a numeric value is defined with 1 or more decimal places, this symbol will be inserted into the string of numbers from the current value of the dynamic variable. In some countries a comma (,) might be expected to indicate the start of decimal positions.  |
| Grouping separator; Character edit | any            | , (comma)      | FOR NUMERIC VARIABLES: The symbol used to separate whole  numbers into groups of 3 digits each. A value of 'B' means there will be no grouping of the whole number digits. |
|                                    |                |                | FOR CHARACTER VARIABLES: The following values can be used to escape or replace single quotes or commas contained in the variable value: **C** = replace any comma (,) X'6B' with a space (X'40'), **Q** =  replace any single quote (') X'7D' with a space (X'40'), **D** = replace both a comma and a single quote with a space, **E** = escape a single quote by inserting an extra single quote or **F** = replace comma with space AND escape a single quote by doubling |
|Suppress leading zeros | 0, 1           | 0              | - 0=no (default value) |
|                       |                |                | - 1=yes                |
|                       |                |                | - When this field is set to zero or is left blank, all the size positions of the full numeric size will be filled with zeros at positions higher than the greatest significant digit, such as: 00345.67                |
|                       |                |                | - When the value is 1, this same example value would be returned left-adjusted and without leading zeros, as: 345.67                |
| Negative value symbol | any            | B (= none)     | If this field is not blank or set to the special value of 'B', then the characters typed into this field will be inserted into the value that is returned whenever the dynamic variable value is requested, and the numeric value is negative. The location of these characters is controlled by the next two fields. |
| Negative symbol position (location) | B = before,    | B              | When characters are specified for the negative value symbol,  this field indicates whether the negative symbol should appear before or after the string of numbers. |
| Negative symbol position (relative distance) | 1 - 9          | 1              | When characters are specified for the negative value symbol, this field indicates how far the negative symbol should be from the first (before) or last (after) digit in the number. A value of 1 means that the symbol will appear immediately next to the number.  |
| Positive value symbol | any            | B (= none)     | If this field is not blank or set to the special value of 'B', then the characters typed into this field will be inserted into the value that is returned whenever the dynamic variable value is requested, and the numeric value is positive. The location of these characters is controlled by the next two fields. |
| Positive symbol position (location) | B = before,    | B              | When characters are specified for the positive value symbol,  this field indicates whether the positive symbol should appear before or after the string of numbers. |
| Positive symbol position (relative distance) | 1 - 9          | 1              | When characters are specified for the positive value symbol, this field indicates how far the positive symbol should be from the first (before) or last (after) digit in the number. A value of 1 means that the symbol will appear immediately next to the number.  |
| Currency symbol | any            | $             | For numeric variables, a non-blank value in this field will be inserted before the edited number in a position specified by the next two fields. This currency symbol would appear before any negative or positive symbol, if that other symbol were specified to appear before the number itself. |
| Currency symbol position (reference point) | F, (.)    | F     | When a currency symbol is specified for a numeric variable, this field indicates how the relative distance (in the next field) will be computed:  |
|                                    |                |    | - F = float: The currency symbol will be positioned relative to the highest significant digit (or relative to the highest zero-fill character, if leading zeros are not suppressed). |
|                                    |                |    | - (.) = fixed: A period character indicates that the currency symbol should appear a fixed number of positions to the left of the decimal point. If the number of digits returned for a value is greater than this distance, the currency symbol will appear immediately next to the left-most digit of the number. The fixed position is useful when comparing a dynamic variable numeric value to a string that was extracted from a printed report where the currency symbol always appears in a fixed column of the report line. |
| Currency symbol position (relative distance) | 1 - 99         | 1              | Combined with the reference point specified above, this value determines the number of positions to the left of the number string where the currency symbol will appear. A value of 1 means that the currency symbol will appear immediately to the left of the left-most digit (or other character,  if a positive/negative sign is used) in the numeric string.  |
| Time of last update | IBM i time stamp | Program defined | Either the time when the add/change/copy function was completed for this record, or the last time the record was updated by the SETDYNVAR command. |

#### Functions
