# Message Management Overview

The Message Management feature, when enabled, allows the IBM i LSAM to respond to messages arriving at monitored message queues, including messages issued by jobs. The predefined IBM i LSAM responses can deliver answers to messages requiring a response as well as send events to SAM when a message appears. This same Message Management server function of the LSAM supports the job-specific message responses that may be defined when building IBM i job master records in the OpCon User Interface.

:::tip
The LSAM Message Management function must be started in order for the job-specific message management defined in the OpCon job master to take effect.
