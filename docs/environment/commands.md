# Environment Management Commands

## SMASETLIBL

The command SMASETLIBL or its command processor program SMASETLIBC can
be used interactively to conveniently change the interactive job's
library list. They can also be used by programmers as a tool for
programming solutions that complies with the new IBM i LSAM environment
management rules. This command (and its subprogram) performs the
function of finding a library list and then replacing the job's library
list.

From IBM i command entry, type the command **SMAGPL/SMASETLIBL** and
press '**F4**\> (Prompt) to reveal the parameters required by this
command:

Prompting the SMASETLIBL Command

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            Set Library List for SMA (SMASETLIBL)
                                                               
                                                 Type choices, press Enter.

Environment name . . . . . . . .   [\*SELECT   ]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}    \*SELECT, \*DEFAULT or name            Display completion message?  . .   [\*VERBOSE]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}      \*SILENT, \*VERBOSE

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The environment name parameter (ENV) supports three possible values, the
same as are supported by the STRSMA command (except that the default in
this case is different). Refer to the [STRSMA Command](/operations/lsam#the-strsma-command) for more
information about the environment parameter and its values.

The default ENV parameter value for the SMASETLIBL command is
(\*SELECT). This value was chosen as the default because in many cases
where this command is being used, there is a choice to be made, and it
is much easier to specify a correct environment name by selecting it
from a list. (In contrast, the STRSMA command was set to use (\*DEFAULT)
as the default, so that former users of the IBM i LSAM would not need
any special training about LSAM environment management in order to
successfully enter the LSAM menu system.)

Since the SMASETLIBL command was created for use behind the scenes (or
in batch mode operations) to set a correct library list, an additional
parameter is provided to control whether or not a completion message is
displayed that shows how the library list is set. In batch mode, it
would normally be undesirable or unnecessary for a command to provide a
completion message about its results, although this is allowed.

: SMASETLIBL Command Parameters

## SMALIBMGT

The SMALIBMGT command provides access to authorized users to a tool that
may be used to establish new environments and build or modify their
library lists.

:::caution
The successful operation of the LSAM environment depends on correct specifications in the control files that are being maintained. Read this discussion very carefully before attempting to use this maintenance function.
:::

### Characteristics

1. The command has no parameters.
2. This display shows a list format that supports data entry right into
    the list. In order to change existing records, type over the
    information and press '**Enter**\> to complete the update. The user
    can add a new environment by typing the environment name and its
    associated values on a blank line, and then press '**Enter**\> to
    complete adding it to the master file. When executed, the command
    starts by presenting the user with a list of existing environment
    names. It is possible to define up to 250 new environments, and the
    PageDown key (available as long as the indicator "More..." appears
    at the lower, right corner of the screen) continues to display
    subsequent pages of input-capable rows until the
    250[th]{style="font-size: 80%;vertical-align: super;"} row is on     display (at which point the "More..." indicator changes to display
    "Bottom").
3. This maintenance function builds and maintains two physical files
    that are stored in the LSAM utility library SMAGPL:
    - SMALIBF00 = Environment master file (maintained from screen
        SMALBD00-1)
    - SMALIBF10 = Library master file (maintained from screen
        SMALIBD00-2)

- **Screen Title**: SMA Environment Management
- **Screen ID**: SMALIBD00-1

:  

##### Options

- **4=Remove**: This option temporarily selects and environment to be
    purged from the control files. As illustrated in the Confirm Remove
    Environments figure below, the list of one or more environments
    selected for deletion are presented for final confirmation on a
    different list display before the system is actually purged. When an
    environment control record is deleted, all the library records
    associated with that environment are also deleted. This option is
    provided in case an incorrect environment definition was entered in
    error, or when a test environment is being completely purged from
    the system. Otherwise, this option must not be used for an existing
    or planned environment. By using this option, the LSAM software is
    disabled from supporting that environment.
- **5=Disp Libs**: This option provides access to a separate display
    where the list of libraries for one environment is shown. When used
    from the SMALIBMGT command, it is possible to add, change or remove
    libraries from the environment definition. When used from the
    SMALIBINQ command, the list of libraries are presented in
    display-only mode.

##### Functions

- **F3=Exit**: Press '**F3**\> to completely leave this function. If
    '**Enter**\> was not pressed to commit any data entry changes, all
    changes typed on the screen are lost. Press '**F3**\> to
    intentionally escape from the program without making changes, or
    after changes have been made, press '**F3**\> to end the
    maintenance function. If pressing '**Enter**\> causes an error
    message to be returned, the changed is not made. If an error message
    is returned and '**F3**\> is pressed without making the necessary
    changes and pressing '**Enter**\> again, the program will end
    without making changes.
- **F5=Refresh**: This function key can be used to restore the
    original library list, as long as '**F14**\> has not been pressed
    or '**Enter**\> (Confirm) has not been used to commit any changes
    to the database. If '**F14**\> or '**Enter**\> (Confirm) were
    previously pressed, then '**F5**\> can only refresh the data back
    to the state it was in when the last set of updates was confirmed.
    This function key is provided to restore the original library list
    and start the data entry over again. Any changes typed before
    pressing '**F5**\> (Refresh) are lost (as long as they were not
    previously confirmed).
- **F12=Cancel**: From this screen, '**F12**\> works exactly like
    '**F3**\>.
- **Enter**: Whenever '**Enter**\> is pressed, any changes made to
    the data on the environment list display are first edited, and then
    committed to the control file (as long as there are no errors). If
    the program returns one or more error messages (displayed on line 24
    of the screen as fields in error are highlighted), then no data
    updates take place. The errors need to be corrected and
    '**Enter**\> needs to be pressed again for the data to be
    committed.
- More\... **PageDown/PageUp**: Not shown on the display (but implied
    by the presence of the "More..." and "Bottom" indicators at the
    bottom-hand right corner of the screen) are the subfile paging
    function keys. The subfile paging function keys do not return
    control to the program. They can be pressed whenever the system
    makes them available in order to display and update as many records
    (up to the limit of 250) as require updating. It is allowed to press
    '**Page Down**\> or '**Page Up**\> as many times as necessary
    before using '**Enter**\> or another function key. No data changes
    are either made or lost by pressing the '**Page Down**\>/'**Page
    Up**\> key. '**Page Down**\> and '**Page Up**\> work in a similar
    fashion on the Remove Environments list display.

##### Functions

**F14 = Confirm**: This function key must be pressed in order to
complete the action of actually removing environment records. When
'F14\> is pressed, both the environment master record and its
associated library records are removed from the control files. Once
'F14\> has been pressed, only new data entry can be used to restore the
deleted environment information. There is no programmed un-delete
function.

### Option 5=Disp Libs

Option 5=Disp Libs from Work with Environments provides access to a list
of the libraries that define the selected environment. This is the only
method of access to the function that can be used to maintain
environment library lists. When the list of libraries displays, it shows
the name of the selected environment on the second title line.

- **Screen Title**: SMA Environment Management
- **Screen ID**: SMALIBD00-2

From the Work with Library List function, type in new library names or
change library names, specify the order in which the libraries appear in
a library list, identify the libraries that perform each of the three
IBM i LSAM roles, and optionally provide a description of each library.

This maintenance function builds and maintains a physical file that is
stored in the LSAM utility library SMAGPL: SMALIBF10 = Library master
file.

The library list display panel allows any new data to be keyed directly
into empty fields or over new fields. There is no function key like
'**F6**\> (Add) to create new records. Instead, new records are created
whenever a new library name is typed in and they are confirmed by
pressing '**Enter**\>.

Up to 250 libraries can be defined for a single list, corresponding to
the maximum number of libraries supported by IBM i. It is recommended to
limit the number of libraries in the list to 25 or less. This helps the
functions that were programmed for older versions of IBM i, which
supported a library list of only 25 names, remain compatible.

'**Page Down**\> continues to display subsequent pages of input-capable
rows until the 250[th]{style="font-size: 80%;vertical-align: super;"} row is on display.

:::note
The PageDown key is available as long as the indicator "More..." appears at the lower right-hand corner of the screen. On the 250th row the "More..." indicator changes to display "Bottom"
:::

As new library names are typed in, the maintenance program attempts to
honor the order in which the names were typed. The sequence number next
to a library can be changed in order to force the library into a new
position in the list.

No updates to the file take place until '**Enter**\> is pressed to edit
the data and press '**Enter**\> again in Confirm mode when the final
list is displayed for review. When '**Enter**\> is pressed the first
time after making any changes, the maintenance program edits the Type
values (refer to discussion on the Type field, below).

Once it is finished, it sorts the library names according to (1) the
sequence number assigned to them or (2) the order in which the library
names were entered (if the sequence numbers were not entered or erased).

If the updated library list passes all edits, the sorted library list is
presented for review. This provides a chance to make any corrections to
the order of the libraries.

:::note
Library names entered at the top line, numbered zero, become the entry on line 10 after '**Enter**\> is pressed.
:::

In order to remove a library from the list, clear the name of the
library. The maintenance program ignores any other data entered in a row
if the library name is blank. It assumes that if the library name filed
is left blank, the rest of the row is to be ignored. Any blanked library
names do not appear in the final sorted list of libraries. If a library
was incorrectly removed from the list, press '**F5**\> (Refresh) to
restore the original list and not confirm an update. It is also possible
to press '**F12**\> (Cancel) from the confirmation display to return to
the environment maintenance screen without updating the library list.

The information about the Type field, in the Fields table above, is very
important for the proper operation of the IBM i LSAM software. It is
critical that all three Type values be entered for any library list that
is used to operate an LSAM environment. When the Type values are
specified, they MUST be specified in the following order (meaning that
the libraries being assigned these Type values must be in this order),
and only one library may be assigned to each value: SMADTA, SMAPTF and
SMAPGM.

:::note
Library lists that are being created for use during Restricted Mode operations do not need to have the Type values assigned.

- **F3 = Exit**: Press '**F3**\> to completely leave this function.
    If '**Enter**\> was not pressed to commit any data entry changes,
    all changes typed on the screen are lost. Press '**F3**\> to
    intentionally escape from the entire maintenance function without
    making changes, or after changes have been made, press '**F3**\> to
    end the maintenance function. If pressing '**Enter**\> causes an
    error message to be returned, the changed is not made. If an error
    message is returned and '**F3**\> is pressed without making the
    necessary changes and pressing '**Enter**\> again, the program will
    end without making changes. The same holds true for the update
    confirmation display. When '**F14**\> (Confirm) is offered, press
    '**F3**\> to exit the maintenance function and none of the changes
    presented for confirmation is made.
- **F5=Refresh**: This function key can be used to restore the
    original library list as long as '**Enter**\> (Confirm) has not
    been pressed to commit any changes to the database. If '**Enter**\>
    (Confirm) was previously pressed, then '**F5**\> can only refresh
    the data back to the state it was in when the last set of updates
    was confirmed. This function key is provided to restore the original
    library list and start data entry over again. Any changes typed
    before pressing '**F5**\> (=Refresh) are lost (as long as they were
    not previously confirmed).
- **F12 = Return**: This function key returns the display to the list
    of environments. If '**F14**\> (Confirm) was not pressed to commit
    any data changes, then all changes are lost. If the confirmation
    process was completed, the normal procedure is to press '**F12**\>
    (Return) to go back to the list of environments for more work on
    another environment. '**F12**\> shows as a Cancel function instead
    of Return while the data entry confirmation display (illustrated in
    diagram 5) is on the screen.
- **PageDown/PageUp**: Not shown on the display (but implied by the
    presence of the "More..." and "Bottom" indicators at the
    bottom-hand right corner of the screen) are the subfile paging
    function keys. The subfile paging function keys do not return
    control to the program. It is allowed to press them whenever the
    system makes them available in order to display and update as many
    records (up to the limit of 250) as desired. It is allowed to press
    '**Page Down**\> or '**Page Up**\> as many times as necessary
    before pressing '**Enter**\> or another function key. No data
    changes are either made or lost by pressing '**Page
    Down**\>/'**Page Up**\>. '**Page Down**\> and '**Page Up**\> work
    in a similar fashion on the Remove Environments list display.
- **Enter**: Whenever '**Enter**\> is pressed, any changes made to
    the data on library list display are edited. If there are no errors
    the entered data is sorted for re-display. Once the data edit is
    passed, press '**Enter**\> again in Confirm mode to commit the
    changes.

#### Confirm mode

An example of the confirmation screen for changes to a library list is
shown below. Note the change to the instruction line two near the top of
the display.

The example above illustrates that a user has added a library named
SMAUTILITY to the bottom of the library list for the environment named
SMADEFAULT. (This would not normally be valid in a client installation,
since there is no library named SMAUTILITY being distributed by SMA with
the IBM i LSAM.)

## SMALIBINQ

SMA supplies an inquiry-only function that supports read-only access to
both the Environment control file (SMAGPL/SMALIBF00) and the Library
control file (SMAGPL/SMALIBF10). This inquiry capability was designed to
be used in two different ways:

- The command SMALIBINQ supports direct access to the inquiry
    functions for use by specially authorized users, such as support
    personnel, system administrators, programmers and the like.
- The inquiry function supports an option 1=Select that returns the
    name of the selected environment. This select option is used by the
    STRSMA command and the SMASETLIBL command when the environment
    parameter is set to \*SELECT.

### Environment Inquiry

For either purpose mentioned above, the environment list display looks
the same.

- **Screen Title**: SMA Environment Management
- **Screen ID**: SMALIBD00-1

##### Fields

For a detailed explanation of the fields appearing in these inquiry
screens, please refer to the documentation of the command SMALIBMGT.

##### Options

- **1=Select**: When the inquiry function is called directly from the
    command SMALIBINQ, the select option serves no purpose. If an
    environment is selected with option 1, it is ignored when the
    program exits and the command ends. The select option does not set
    any persistent environment variable; it just returns the selected
    value in a program CALL parameter field that can be used when
    another program does the calling.
- **5=Disp Libs**: This option causes the program to show the library
    list that was created for the selected environment. If libraries
    have not already been assigned to the environment, an empty list
    screen is displayed for the library inquiry.

##### Functions

- **F3=Exit**: This function key terminates the inquiry program. If
    the inquiry program was called to perform the Select process, the
    '**F3**\> signal to the calling program causes that program to
    exit. If the calling program was the IBM i LSAM sign on process (as
    initiated by the STRSMA command), then the user is not logged into
    the LSAM menu system but is either logged off their workstation or
    returned to the command entry line where the STRSMA command was
    typed.
- **F5=Refresh**: This function key causes the list display to be
    reloaded as if the program was starting from the beginning. The only
    time Refresh would show new data is if someone else has performed
    environment maintenance while the original list inquiry program was
    already on display.
- **F12=Cancel**: This function key has the same effect as '**F3**\>
    (Exit).

### Library Inquiry

This inquiry is provided for information purposes only. It might be
helpful for users who are trying to select an environment to know about
the library list that defines the environment. Option 5=Disp Libs from
the environment inquiry screen brings up a list of libraries like the
one shown in the following figure.

- **Screen Title**: SMA Environment Management
- **Screen ID**: SMALIBD00-2

##### Fields

For a detailed explanation of the fields appearing in these inquiry
screens, please refer to the documentation of the command SMALIBMGT.

##### Function Keys

- **F3=Exit**: This function key completely terminates the inquiry
    program. When the inquiry program is called to perform the Select
    process, the '**F3**\> signal to the calling program causes the
    program to exit. If the calling program was the IBM i LSAM sign on
    process (as initiated by the STRSMA command), then the user is not
    logged into the LSAM menu system but is either logged off their
    workstation or returned to the command entry line where the STRSMA
    command was typed. '**F3**\> from the library inquiry screen
    bypasses the environment inquiry screen as the whole inquiry process
    is ended.
- **F5=Refresh**: This function key causes the list display to be
    reloaded as if the program was starting from the beginning. The only
    time Refresh would show new data is if someone else has performed
    environment maintenance while the original list inquiry program was
    already on display.
- **F12=Cancel**: This function key ends the library list display and
    returns the user to the list of environments.
