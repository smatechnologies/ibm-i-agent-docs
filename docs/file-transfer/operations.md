# SMA File Transfer Operations

## SMAFT Parameters -- Critical Configuration Settings

The SMA File Transfer parameters for the IBM i LSAM are discussed in
detail below, under the SMA File Transfer Screens and Windows. Before
the IBM i LSAM SMAFT Server is started or SMAFT Agent jobs may be
submitted to the IBM i LSAM, it is required to set the following
parameters:

- The SMAFT Server IP Address must be specified in the IBM i SMAFT
    Parameters. Currently, this same address is used for both LSAM job
    scheduling transactions and for SMA File Transfer communications
    with the IBM i LSAM, so this IP address must be the same as the IP
    address specified for the LSAM Parameters.
- Confirm and/or update the SMAFT Server Port setting in the IBM i
    SMAFT Parameters.
- Confirm and/or update the SMAFT Agent port range start value in the
    IBM i SMAFT Parameters.

In addition to the IBM i SMAFT Parameter settings, the following
parameters must be set in the OpCon machine table record, advanced
settings, under the File Transfer Settings tab, for this IBM i system:

- TCP/IP Address: The LSAM will send the value from the IBM i LSAM
    SMAFT Parameters automatically whenever the LSAM first connects to
    the OpCon server.
- File Transfer Settings: File Transfer Role = set this to "Both"
    because the IBM i LSAM supports both the PUSH and PULL file transfer
    methods (that is, the file transfer job can be started on the Source
    machine or the Target machine, as specified in the OpCon job master
    record for each job).
- File Transfer Settings: File Transfer Port Number = this must match
    the SMAFT Server Port setting in the IBM i SMAFT Parameters, so that
    this number may be sent to the SMAFT Agent on other LSAMs,
    instructing them how to contact the IBM i SMAFT Server.

## SMAFT Network Address Translation Table

A Network Address Translation (NAT) table is available for the SMA File
Transfer Agent. This table supports translating the OpCon Machine IP
Address for a remote SMAFT Server to a different IP address and/or port,
such as a local virtual IP address. Please contact SMA Support for
assistance with using this feature. It should only be required if you
have configured virtual IBM i partitions that are hosted by a Host IBM i
partition, depending on the method used by the Host partition to serve
IP address connection to the hosted partitions.

### Example Use Case

One proven case where a NAT table was required involved the IBM i host
partition that was hosting one or more client partitions. These
partitions were configured to use the IBM i network address translation
(NAT) method for communications traffic routing. The public IP addresses
of the client partitions were being contacted at the host partition, and
then the host partition used its IBM i NAT to find and use the local
virtual IP address for forwarding data communication traffic.

The OpCon Agent for IBM i, rather than be configured to use IBM i APIs
to query the IBM i NAT, instead has been configured to use its own NAT
table. This strategy was considered to be less sensitive to any changes
in the IBM i operating system, and it may also be more likely compatible
with other (currently untested) methods of forwarding network traffic
from a host partition to a client partition.

In this example use case, the host partition received a SMAFT job start
request from OpCon. The job start request instructed the host partition
to use the public IP address for one of its hosted (client) partitions.
However, the host could not use the public IP address for its SMAFT
sockets communication method because that address is actually contacted,
initially, at the host itself. In order to effectively establish a
direct connection between the host and its client partition, the SMAFT
NAT table provided the local virtual IP address (and port) that should
be used by the OpCon LSAM SMAFT Agent communication program to open a
socket connection with the client partition.

### Work with SMAFT Agent NAT Table

The maintenance function to add NAT table records is found in LSAM
sub-menu 8 as menu option 8.

Use this maintenance function to add or change SMAFT Agent NAT table
entries that will enable a connection between virtualized IBM i
partitions, when the public IP address for the SMAFT Server is not
supported from the SMAFT Agent partition for this type of communication
connection.

Each SMAFT Agent NAT table entry is comprised of the following fields,
where all data values are required:

- Original IP address
- Original port number
- New IP address
- New port number

Refer to the SMA File Transfer Screens and Windows section, below, for
details about using the SMAFT Agent NAT Table maintenance function.

## Start SMA File Transfer Server (STRSMAFT)

The Start SMAFT Server option tells the LSAM to listen for SMAFT file
transfer requests from other LSAMs. The SMAFT Server job started
automatically whenever the LSAM servers are started. The automatic start
option is documented below under the topic SMAFT Parameters. The
following procedure describes how to manually start the SMAFT Server
when the automatic option is not being used.

[Start SMAFT Server]

1. In the command line, enter **SMAGPL/STRSMA**. For more information,
    refer to the [STRSMA Command](/operations/lsam#the-strsma-command).
2. Enter **8** to choose the **SMAFT File Transfer** menu in the SMA
    Main Menu.
3. Enter **1** to choose the Start SMAFT Server (STRSMAFT) option in
    the SMA File Transfer menu.
4. The result of starting the SMAFT Server is that job SMAFTS is
    submitted to the LSAM subsystem configured in the LSAM Parameters.
    Confirm that the SMAFT Server is active by using the Check LSAM
    subsystem status, as follows.
5. Enter **8** to choose the **SMAFT File Transfer menu** (if not
    already there) in the SMA Main Menu.
6. Enter **3** to Work with SMAFT jobs in the SMA File Transfer menu.
7. Confirm that job SMAFTS is running among the active jobs in the
    subsystem.

## End SMAFT Server (ENDSMAFT)

The End SMAFT Server option tells the LSAM to discontinue listening for
SMA File Transfer requests.

[End SMAFT Server]

1. In the command line, enter **SMAGPL/STRSMA**. For more information,
    refer to the [STRSMA Command](/operations/lsam#the-strsma-command).
2. Enter **8** to choose the **SMA File Transfer** menu in the SMA Main
    Menu.
3. Enter **2** to choose the **End SMAFT Server** (ENDSMAFT) option in
    the SMA File Transfer menu.
4. The result of ending the SMAFT Server is that job SMAFTS is ended
    from the LSAM subsystem configured in the LSAM Parameters. Confirm
    that the SMAFT Server is no longer active by using the Check LSAM
    subsystem status, as follows.
5. Enter **8** to choose the **SMA File Transfer menu** (if not already
    there) in the SMA Main Menu.
6. Enter **3** to Work with SMAFT jobs in the SMA File Transfer menu.
7. Confirm that job SMAFTS is NOT present among the active jobs in the
    subsystem.

## Specifying IBM i Files in OpCon/xps EM Job Master

The OpCon/xps EM uses a unique job type for SMA File Transfer jobs that
is not specific to any one operating system. The operating system at
either the Source or Destination end of a file transfer is implied by
the Machine name that is selected as the Source or the Destination.

When the selected Machine is running IBM i and the file or table being
transferred is stored in the DB2 UDB native database (not the IFS), the
Source File or the Destination File is specified in the following
manner:

**LIBRARY/FILE(MEMBER)**

\...where (MEMBER) is optional. The concept of a file data member is
unique to IBM i. Most DB2 UDB database files, and all SQL tables have
only one (implied) data member, so it is usually not necessary to
specify the member name. The exception is when data is read from, or
written to a source physical file, such as program source files that
store multiple members for each program's source code.

Consider the following application notes when SMA File Transfer is used
with files controlled by IBM i:

- It may sometimes be convenient to use SMA File Transfer to extract a
    program source member from the DB2 database file that is stored in
    EBCDIC and specify that SMAFT should translate that source member to
    an ASCII character set as the source member is transferred to a MS
    Windows stream file. This procedure would make it convenient to open
    and read the source member using a Windows file editor.
- The IBM i special file (object) type of Save File appears to be a
    database file with binary content. Save files are actually comprised
    of records that are 512 bytes in length, as the data is stored under
    DB2 UDB. The SMA IBM i LSAM SMAFT programs recognize this important,
    special file type and they know how to extract or restore save files
    that have been removed and later sent back to the database. This
    means it is possible, using the SMAFT Binary file transfer Data
    Type, to send a save file to any other type of system, and then to
    restore that save file to any other IBM i database. In order to
    assure that the save file contents will be preserved, the
    Destination save file must exist (defining it as a save file using
    the CRTSAVF command), and the SMAFT option to overwrite an existing
    file should be specified.

### Identifying Attributes of Files Sent to IBM i

Some operating systems make it impossible for the SMA File Transfer
programs to determine the exact definition of how data is stored in a
file. For example, stream files sent from MS Windows or from a UNIX or
Linux system to IBM i may actually include fixed-length records, but
only the user of the file knows about this attribute because a basic
stream file from these operating systems does not store this type of
attribute with the file object (as is the case with DB2 database files
within the IBM i operating system).

In these cases, it may be desirable to tell the IBM i SMAFT program(s)
about the record length by adding a special extension to the Destination
File Name field in the OpCon SMA File Transfer job master record.

#### ,REC=00000

Only certain LSAMs support this special convention; the IBM i LSAM is
one of these.

Following the Destination File Name, add a comma immediately after the
last non-blank character of the file name, then type the special keyword
string REC= and also 1 to 5 digits that represent the fixed length of
the record in the file.

:::tip Example
A MS Windows stream file is known to contain fixed-length records that are each 80 bytes long. The file must be transferred to an IBM i DB2 database file. The Destination File Name field in the OpCon File Transfer job master record is entered using the IBM i DB2 file name format and extended by the special REC= keyword as follows:

```shell
. TARGETLIB/FILENAME,REC=80
```

:::

It is not necessary to use the REC= keyword if the target file already
exists in the IBM i DB2 database because the IBM i LSAM SMAFT programs
are able to extract the record length value from the existing DB2 file.
However, when a new file must be created, then the IBM i LSAM SMAFT
programs can rely on the REC= keyword to set the value of the file
record length as the new file is being created.
