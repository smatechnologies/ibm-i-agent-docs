## LSAM Utilities Configuration

- **Screen Title**: LSAM Utilities Configuration
- **Screen ID**: LSAUTLD301

##### Menu Pathways

Main Menu \> Events and Utilities (#3) \> LSAM Utilities configuration (#7)

##### Fields


| Field                      | Default  | Description                |
| -----                      | -------  | -----------                |
| Capture data audit logging | N        | -   Y=yes, N=no. This flag controls the detailed logging feature that can be viewed using LSAM menus 2, 3 or 4: option 9. The log will contain entries about any data capture action and also about captured data response rules. This logging capability is the only way to record exactly what happens when Captured Data Response Rules are executed, so it can be used as a means of auditing the response commands that are executed.          |
|                            |          | -   SMA recommends setting this field to Y=yes, especially when new data capture and captured data response rules are being used for the first time. Data capture is always performed by the SCANSPLF utility, and it may also be performed by Message Management or during Operator Replay script execution. |
| Use aggressive FTP job failure?  | Y        | -   Y = Yes: Report an FTP job failed if the FTP log file does not contain a message # 226 indicating that the job completed normally. |
|                            |          | -   N = No: Some systems or FTP job connections might not produce a 226 message, even though the file transfer completed 
normally. For these systems, set this control field to N = No to allow the Agent to report a successful job completion unless the FTP job log file contains a recognized failure message.       |
| Scan Rule maint fmt 1- or 2-page | 2        | Control how the function that maintains Scan Rules will display all the  available fields:          |
|                            |          | 1 = The original display format tried to include all the Scan Rule fields on one display page. This makes it easy to see the whole Rule at once, but the screen was too busy and was hard to read.      |
|                            |          | 2 = The new display format shows the most critical and commonly used Scan Rule fields on page 1, and then displays the remaining, optional fields on page 2 (after pressing the Enter key).            |
| Job log msgs @ post-job SCANSPLF | 0 (zero) | The SCANSPLF command supports a JOBLOGMSG parameter that tells the command to send progress and error messages to the IBM i Job Log for the job where the command is executing.                 |
|                            |          | This control file value forces the JOBLOGMSG to the desired logging option when the SCANSPLF command  has been appended to the OpCon Job Master: Call (command or program) line. This special purpose use for the SCANSPLF command (as described in "Extended Discussion of Parameters" under Chapter 3: IBM I LSAM Configuration) would usually not need to add a large number of IBM i Job Log messages to the single IBM i LSAM Server Job that processes all of these special-request executions of SCANSPLF.               |
|                            |          | Sending the SCANSPLF progress and error messages to the IBM i Job Log can be useful for debugging unexpected behavior of the SCANSPLF command. |
|                            |          | VALUES: Y or 1 = Yes, do send LSAM log messages also to the IBM i Job Log of the LSAM Server job. N or 0 (zero) = No, do not copy the LSAM log messages  to the IBM i Job Log.      |
| Dynamic variable start character   | C0       | - The IBM i internal EBCDIC character, in hexadecimal format, that marks the start of a Dynamic Variable token.|
|                            |          | -   The first field is the data entry field where a new value can be typed. However, please note the CAUTION text near the top of this display!|
|                            |          | -   To the right of the data entry fields are (1) the current value stored in the master file, and (2) the IBM i 5250 screen character that can be typed and will display when the current value is being used.|
| Dynamic variable end character      | D0       | -   The IBM i internal EBCDIC character, in hexadecimal format, that marks the end of a Dynamic Variable token.   |
|                                     |          | - Also refer to also notes for the Start Character, above. |
|                                     |          | - ** OpCon File Arrival $@Variables (replace $@)**  |
|                                     |          | - The IBM i File Arrival job sub-type, set in an OpCon Job Master record, can support more LSAM command options than appear in the Job Master record maintenance panel. These are job options that are not the same as, for example, the Windows (MSLSAM) version of File Arrival jobs.|
|                                     |          | - For the command parameters of either the CHKFILE or the CHKIFSFIL commands, used by the IBM i LSAM to process File Arrival jobs, these additional command KEYWORDS can be set by adding entries to the OpCon Job Master: Variables tab.|
|                                     |          | - For each command keyword, add the following two special characters in front of the keyword name, telling the LSAM Job Scheduler to add these KEYWORDS to the CHKFILE or CHKIFSFIL command line that the LSAM builds for a File Arrival job.|
|                                     |          | - For example, the keywords CRTREFDATE, JOBENDTIME and RECHKFREQ are often useful, and they would be set by adding the following special variable names to the OpCon Job Master: Variables table:|
|                                     |          | - ``` $@CRTREFDATE, $@JOBENDTIME, $@RECHKFREQ ``` |
|                                     |          | -  However, the special characters $ and @ are not always well supported by IBM i partitions that do not use the CCSID(37) = English EBCDIC character set. For non-English IBM i partitions, use the following two control values to specify which two characters should be used to signal the LSAM that these are command line KEYWORDS and not regular LSAM Dynamic Variable settings. |
| File Arrival parm ID character 1      | X'5B'  | Hexadecimal value X'5B' represents the US dollar sign ($). Type a pair of characters that are the hexadecimal value of a different special character to be used by the local IBM i site. |
| File Arrival parm ID character 2      |  X'7C' | Hexadecimal value X'7C' represents an "at sign" (@). Type a pair of characters that are the hexadecimal value of a different special character to be used by the local IBM i site. |
|                            |          | **NOTE**: Some non-English sites have discovered that their IBM i workstation keyboards can use a US dollar sign (X’5B’) also for this character 2 value, so that a KEYWORD variable name example would be: $$RECHKFREQ |
| DynVar external start      | 4A       | The EBCDIC character, in hexadecimal format, that will result when an external ASCII machine, such as a Windows PC, has typed the Dynamic Variable token start character (e.g., { ), but then that value is translated from ASCII to EBCDIC as the transaction data arrives at the IBM i LSAM data communications program. This value will be replaced by the IBM i internal EBCDIC Dynamic Variable start character that is identified in the previous pair of control values. |
|                            |          | **Note**: The external start/end characters usually only need attention in non-U.S. environments. Please contact SMA Technologies Support for assistance in case Dynamic Variable tokens used in OpCon job master records for IBM i jobs are not working correctly.  |
| DynVar external end character       | 5A       | - The EBCDIC character, in hexadecimal format, that marks a the end of a Dynamic Variable token | 
|                                     |          | - Also refer to notes for the External Start Character, above. |  

##### Functions

**F12=Cancel**: Quits the maintenance function and returns to the Events and Utilities menu.

## Work with SCANSPLF Applications

:::note
In previous versions of the IBM i LSAM, there was a separate Application master file that had to be maintained. Now, the Application ID has become just the primary key field that helps gather Scan Rule records into groups. There is still a Work with SCANSPLF Applications function on the LSAM menu \# 3, but it is now only a convenience tool used to find applications and to copy or delete whole Application sets of Scan Rules at once.
:::

- **Screen Title**: Work with SCANSPLF Applications
- **Screen ID**: LSAUTLD301

##### Menu Pathways

Main Menu \> Events and Utilities (#3) \> Work with SCANSPLF Applications (#3)

##### Fields

-  Search content:   To quickly search for a particular job, enter the first characters of the job name, or any other tracked job log content value, and press <**Enter**>. Any value that appears on the log detail display may be searched for, even though not all values appear in the list display.
-  Opt:              Enter one of the options listed at the top of the display and press <**Enter**> to execute that option for the selected line in the list.

##### Options

- **1=Select**: Select an Application ID and then branch into the Work with Scan Rules function, which will be limited to only the Scan Rules that belong to the selected Application.
- **3=Copy**: Select an Application and copy all of its Scan Rules to a new Application ID. A pop-up window will appear offering an option to also copy any associated Response Rules.
- **4=Delete**: Select one or more Application IDs from the list for deletion. All records selected for deletion are presented in a confirmation list after <**Enter**> is pressed, and no records are deleted until the confirmation display is acknowledged. Remember that this Delete function actually deletes all the Scan Rules that were assigned to the selected Application ID(s). A pop-up window  will appear offering an option to also delete all associated Response Rules.
- **7=Capt chart**: Type option 7 next to any Application line to view a chart of related Capture and Response Rules and Dynamic Variables.
- **8=Export**: Select one or more Applications that will be copied to a save file collection for exporting to a different LSAM  environment. The Export option includes all related records such as Capture Rules and Response Rules, as well as any Dynamic Variable definitions.

##### Functions

- **F3=Exit**: Quits the list display and returns to the menu.
- **F5=Refresh**: Retrieves the latest list information and updates the display.
- **F12=Cancel**: Quits the list display and returns to the menu.
- **F16=Search next**: When a value is entered in the Search content field, or a value shows in pink below this field from the last search request, pressing <**F16**> finds the next (or first) occurrence of the value specified. F16 is useful for finding each desired log entry when there is more than one log entry that satisfies the search request. When a value is first typed into the Search content field, <**F16**> works the same as the <**Enter**> key for starting a new search. However, only <**F16**> may be used to continue a search past the first entry that satisfies the search criteria.
- **F17=Top**: Causes the display to jump to the top of the list. This is the equivalent of the first record in the file, but the sort order controls which records are listed first.
- **F18=Bottom**: Causes the display to jump to the last entry in the list. This is the equivalent of the last record in the log file, but the sort order controls which records are listed last. This function key is very helpful when the file is big.

### Copy SCANSPLF Application

Option 3=Copy supports copying all of the Scan Rules from one Application ID to a new Application ID. After the bulk copy is completed, use option 1=Select from the list of Applications to Work with Scan Rules for the new Application ID.

- **Screen Title**: Copy SCANSPLF Application
- **Screen ID**: LSAJ50R2

##### Menu Pathways

Main Menu \> Events and Utilities (#3) \> Work with SCANSPLF Applications (#3) \> Option 3=Copy

##### Fields

-  From Application:   The From Application field only appears when option 3=Copy has been used.
-  (to) Application:   If option 3=Copy was used, the "to Application" input field is shown, otherwise, a simple "Application" field appears on the next line. Enter the new Application ID that will be used. The Application ID may remain the same, as long as any one of the other three fields will be changed to create a new record. The Application ID field is used for coordinating with Captured Data Response Rules.

##### Functions

- **F3=Exit**: Quits the maintenance function without update and returns to the list display.
- **F5=Refresh**: Restores the original field values that were presented when the maintenance display format first appeared, replacing any data that may have been typed.
- **F12=Cancel**: Quits the maintenance function without update and returns to the menu.

#### Copy/Delete SCANSPLF Application (options 3 and 4)

Whenever the options 3=Copy or 4=Delete are being processed, the program will present a window that offers an opportunity to also copy or delete any Response Rules associated with the Scan Rules that belong to the Application.

This same format of window is presented when individual Scan Rules are copied or deleted (described below).

##### Manage Response Rules Window (Copy)
```
          Manage Response Rules

Copy response rules also?   1  0=No, 1=Yes          
 (Recommended: 1=Yes)

Enter=Select   F12=Cancel
```
##### Manage Response Rules Window (Delete)
```
            Manage Response Rules

Delete response rules also?   1  0=No, 1=Yes
 (Recommended: 1=Yes)

Enter=Select   F12=Cancel
```
##### Fields

- Copy? - or - Delete?:
  -   0=No, 1=Yes                                      
  -   When either option 3=Copy or option 4=Delete is selected, the program offers the option to perform either a copy or a delete of all Response Rules that are related to each Scan Rule that is associated with an Application.
  -   For option 0=No, the copy or delete action is completed, but any associated Response Rules are ignored.  
  -   When this window is presented from the maintenance of individual Scan Rules, it applies only to the Scan Rule(s) being copied and not to the whole Application. 

##### Functions

**F12=Cancel**: Quits the option window and returns to the list control display. (The copy or delete option remains incomplete and must be  restarted, if desired.)

### Display Capture Rules/Response Rules Chart (option 7)

The Capture and Response Rules chart displays are explained in detail under Operator Replay, within the Screens and Windows section, under the title "Operator Replay Capture Chart (opt 7)."

### Export Message Management Parameters (option 8)

Detailed instructions about the data Export and Import functions is provided in Copy Files from Test to Production.

## Work with SPLF Scan Rules

- **Screen Title**: Work with Spool File Scan Rules
- **Screen ID**: LSAJ40R1

For each Application there are one or more Scan Rules that tell the SCANSPLF utility how to search the report spool file(s). Some or all of the Scan Rules may be required to match the input PARAMETERS values supplied by the SCANSPLF command, and there must be a Scan Rule for each possible input parameter. There may also be additional Scan Rules that are not associated with the input PARAMETERS. After defining these Scan Rules it will be possible to associate one or more Captured Data
Response Rules, as described below, in order to perform operations on the data that is found by these Scan Rules or to respond with some command as each Scan Rule is satisfied.

Refer to the How To discussion earlier in this topic for more information about ways to apply Spool File Scan Rules to specific tasks.

##### Menu Pathways

Main Menu \> Events and Utilities menu (#3) \> Work with SPLF Scan Rules (#4).

##### Fields

-  Search content:   Type a value in this field and press <**Enter**> or <**F16**> to initiate a search for a record that has matching data anywhere in the record, including data that might not appear on the list display (but the matching data would appear in the display of the detail of the record). When <**F16**> is pressed a second time, the search continues from after the last matching record, using the same Search content data. Press <**Enter**> a second time (with no options typed), or press <**F5=Refresh**> to start a new search.
-  Opt:              Type option from list displayed near the top of this screen. Refer to options definitions, below.
-  Application:      The Application ID is used to group one or more Scan Rules into a single task that can produce a pass or fail outcome of a job. The Application ID, along with the Sequence number, is critical for identifying data in the Captured Data Log file (which can also hold data from Operator Replay screen capture).
-  SEQ"              The sequence of the Scan Rule, within an Application. This number determines the order in which data Scan Rules are processed. The order of the Scan Rules is critical for rules that are defined to match the input PARAMETERS of the SCANSPLF command. Rules that are not assigned to an input PARAMETER of the SCANSPLF command can be in any order or interspersed among the other rules. However, the order of the Scan Rules may also be governed by the desired outcome of any associated Captured Data Rules, because those responses are also processed within the order of the Sequence number of Scan Rules. The Sequence number will be unique within an Application ID, regardless of how many SPLF Names and/or Job Names are included within an Application.
-  SPLF Name:        The actual name of the IBM i report spool file.
-  Job Name:         The name of the IBM i job that produces the report spool file.
-  SPLNBR:           The spool file number within the Job Name.
-  Description:      Text that helps to identify the purpose of each Scan Rule.

##### Functions

- **F3=Exit**: Return to the LSAM menu.
- **F5=Refresh**: Reload the list display with the latest data from the master file.
- **F6=Add**: Branch to the screen for creating a new Scan Rule record.
- **F11=Sort SPLF/JOB, Sort APP/SEQ\#, Sort APP/SPLF**: Pressing F11 rotates among these three different sorting options for the list display. In each sort mode, the primary sort field heading is colored pink and underlined, and secondary sort fields are also underlined.
- **F12=Cancel**: Return to the LSAM menu.
- **F16=Search next**: When a search argument has been entered in the Search content field, pressing F16 can either start a new search (if the content value was changed) or it can continue a search to look for the next list entry that matches the search argument, starting with the first record after the last match found.
- **F17=Top**: Reposition the list display to show the first record in the list.
- **F18=Bottom**: Reposition the list display to show the last record in the list.
- **F24=More keys**: Use this function key to change the function key legend displayed at the bottom of the screen. All function keys remain active, even if they do not appear in the currently displayed function key legend.

##### Options

- **2=Change**: To change a record, type 2 in the Opt field next to the record(s). Press <**Enter**> to proceed to the Change detail screen.
- **3=Copy**: To copy a record, type 3 in the Opt field next to the record. Press <**Enter**> to proceed to the Copy detail screen. During the copy process, a pop-up window will offer an option to also copy any Response Rules that are associated with the Scan Rule being copied.
- **4=Delete**: To delete one or more records, type 4 next to each record. Press <**Enter**> to proceed to the Delete confirmation window. During the delete process, a pop-up window will offer an option to also delete any Response Rules that are associated with the Scan Rule being deleted.
- **5=Display**: To display record details, type 5 next to each record. Press <**Enter**> to proceed to the display details screen. Typing option 5 next to many or all records at once before pressing <**Enter**> is a convenient way to review all the definition details at once. Press <**Enter**> to advance as each detail screen is presented.

### Add/Change/Copy SPLF Scan Rule

- **Screen Title**: Copy SPLF Scan Rule
- **Screen ID**: OPRR50R2

Refer to the How To discussion earlier in this topic for moreinformation about the meaning and purpose of the fields on this display. Refer to details about the rules and effect of each field in the fields table, below.

##### Fields

Refer to the How To section of this topic for examples of how the following field rules can be used.

:::note
The order of the fields listed in the table below will vary, depending on the setting of the "Scan Rule maint fmt 1- or 2-page" option in the "LSAM Utilities Configuration" screen (documented in previous pages of this section).
:::


| Field                            | Description                      |
+==================================+=================================+
| From fields:                     | When this screen appears in Copy |
mode, the key fields of the      |
| -   Application                  | source record being copied are   |
| -   Sequence                     | shown in this heading area. A    |
| -   SPLF Name                    | new value must be assigned to    |
| -   Job Name                     | the Sequence of the Scan Rule    |
| -   SPLNBR                       | record being created in Copy     |
mode, using the Rule Sequence    |
input field, below. (The other   |
key fields may remain the same   |
in the new, copied record, since |
more than one scan rule is       |
allowed per SPLF Name + Job Name |
+ SPLNBR.)                       |

- Application: This field is used to group one or more Scan Rules into a single task that can be configured to end normally or abnormally, depending on the setting of the Required Rule field in any of its rules. The field permits spaces and special characters.                                 |
  - **Revision Note**: In previous LSAM versions, this field was stored in a separate master file, however, now it is simply the primary key field assigned to each Scan Rule.
- Rule sequence: The order in which the scan rule will be processed, relative to other scan rules under the same Application. The value must be unique within the Application ID, even for a different SPLF Name, Job Name or SPLNBR. 
- Rule description: Text that identifies the purpose of the scan rule, helpful on the Work with SPLF Scan Rules list display.
- SPLF name: The name of the spool file to be scanned. 
- Job name: The IBM i 10-character job name. The special value of *CMD may be used to indicate that the actual job name will be provided at execution time by the SCANSPLF command.
- SPLF number: *ANY, or optionally, a specific spool file number within the Job name, used when more than one spool file of the same name is produced by a single job.
- From/To page:
  -   The scan may optionally be limited to one or more specific pages of a report.  The special value *STR means "from the start," and the special value *END means "to the end."
  -   The special value *END may be used in the From-page field to cause the SCANSPLF command to work backwards from the last line of the report to the first line.  Working from the end of the report combines well with the Incidence count, for example, if it is important to find the second-to-last TOTALS label on a financial     report.
  -   When *END is used for the From-page, it is possible to specify a Positive number for the To-page. A Positive number indicates the limit of pages to scan, starting backwards from the end of the report. For example, (-1) means scan only the last page, (-2) means scan only the last two pages, and so forth. A Positive number in this character field is indicated by type a dash (-) either before or after a number: -1 or 1-
- From/To line (record): The scan may optionally be limited to specific lines on each page of the report. The line counter is reset at the top of each page. This feature might be useful, for example, when a label or value should only be found in the heading line of a report page (keeping in mind that the first heading line 
might actually be printed on line 2 of the page, in which case it would be necessary to specify 2 as the From and the To lines).
- From/To position (column):
  -   The scan may optionally be limited to specific positions on each scanned line of the report. For example, in IBM i job log reports, the severity code of logged messages always appears in positions 36-37.
  -   This pair of control fields has a different effect depending on other fields on the scan rule:
    -   If a scan label is specified, the scan label must be found within the From/To positions on the report line. When the scan label is specified, the From/To positions have no effect on the scan value itself - the scan value may be found anywhere within the report line where the scan label was located.
    -   If a scan label is not specified, then the scan value can only be found starting with the first non-blank character after the From-position, and it cannot extend past the To-position.
    -   When the special value of *CAPT is specified for the scan value and the scan label is not specified and a scan value length greater than zero is entered, 
        then the To-position will be ignored. Only the From-position will be used to find the scan value to be captured, and the captured data will be limited to the specified scan value length.
- Start scan label: Optionally, specify a predictable string of characters that can be found by the scan program in order to locate the scan value within a report line.
- Position after label: When the scan label is specified, indicate where the scan program should look for the scan value. There are four possible value types for this 
field that each cause a different result:
  -   0 (zero) = start with the first non-blank character AFTER the end of the scan label.
  -   Positive number = start at the specified column number AFTER the end of the scan label. If the scan label ends at column 27 and the position-after value is 6, then the scan value to be compared will begin at column 33. 
  -   (-1) = start with column 1 on the report and use the first non-blank character that appears BEFORE the scan label. This value is not valid if the scan label begins at column 1. The search for a scan value will stop with the last character before the start of the scan label, but the scan value can overlap the scan label. If no non-blank characters are found before the scan label starts, then the scan program assumes there is no scan value at the location of the scan label and this scan value will be marked as not found (not matched).
  -   Positive number = start at the specified number of columns BEFORE the start of the scan label. Remember that (-1) has a special meaning, so it cannot be used in this context. If the scan label starts at column 27 and the position-after value is (-15), then the scan value to be compared will begin at column 12.
- (scan) Value, *PARM, *CAPT, DVar: This field is used to specify or describe the scan value. The scan value will be the captured data value stored in the Captured Data Log file and referenced by any captured data response rules. When applicable, this scan value will be compared to the value found in the report at the specified location in order to determine if the scan rule has been matched or not matched. The scan values that may be specified include:
  - A specific value = Any character string may be specified as the value that should be compared to the scan value found at the specified location in the report. For example, this type of rule can be used to find a flag in a financial report that may say "OUT OF BALANCE" in order to cause the SCANSPLF command to fail, so that the OpCon/xps job that executed the SCANSPLF command will show up on the OpCon/xps Schedule as a failed job, triggering an operator response. Leading blank characters
may be left in the scan value field if they must be included in the scan rule match. Use the scan value length to also include trailing blank characters.
:::note
Special values *PARM and *CAPT must be all capital letters.

- (scan) Value, *PARM, *CAPT, DVar (continued...): 
  - *PARM = Use the value specified in one of the input PARAMETERS values of the SCANSPLF command. When the SCANSPLF command supplies input values (that is, the *RULES option for PARAMETERS was not used), there must be the same number of scan rules that use this *PARM special value as there are input parameter values separated by colons (:) in the PARAMETERS keyword of the SCANSPLF command.
  - *CAPT = This special value indicates that the scan rule will not generate a match or nomatch (pass/fail) result. Instead, this type of scan rule will be used only for the purpose of capturing a value at the specified location in the report and then storing that value in the Captured Data Log file. Captured data values can be used to trigger any number of Captured Data Response rules, and the Response rule records may specify that the captured data should also be stored as an LSAM Dynamic Variable or as an LSAM Operator Replay token variable value.
  - DVar = An LSAM Dynamic Variable may be specified in the scan value field. If the Dynamic Variable has already been defined in the LSAM table (remembering that Dynamic Variables may be defined at run-time, in which case they must be anticipated before they appear in the LSAM table), then function key F4=DynVar may be used to select from a list of available Dynamic Variables. The Dynamic Variable name is recognized by the scan program because it is enclosed within the pair of characters registered for this purpose in the LSAM Utility Configuration function (LSAM menu 3, option 7). The default Dynamic Variable enclosure characters are a pair of curly brackets: {var_name}. It is possible to combine a Dynamic Variable with other text that is entered directly into the scan value field, for example: 'Leading characters {var_nam} trailing text'. When the scan rule is executed, the scan program will replace the Dynamic Variable with the value found in the LSAM table at the moment of execution. A Dynamic Variable value may have just been set by a preceding scan rule's Captured Data Response rule.
- Scan value length: When the scan value length is left at zero, the scan program assumes that the length of the scan value is equal to the last non-blank character in the scan value string (that is, the scan value is assumed to be trimmed of trailing blanks, and then the scan value is measured). The scan value length has a different effect depending on the setting of other scan rule fields:
  -   Leave set to be left at zero when using the *PARM scan value. The length of the input PARAMETER value supplied in the SCANSPLF command will determine the length of the character string extracted from the report.
  -   When a specific value is entered into the scan value field, the scan value length can be set to a value longer than the number of trailing non-blank characters in the value in order to tell the scan program that trailing blanks should be considered in the match (pass/fail) rule. For example, if a scan value is entered with two leading blank characters, as: 'VALUE', then the default trimmed length of this scan value used by the scan program would be 7 (2 leading blanks and 5 non-blank characters). If the scan value length is set to 9, then the scan value found in the report must also have 2 blank characters after the non-blank characters.
  -   For the special scan value of *CAPT, use the scan value length combined with the From-position to specify the data that should be captured from the report. For *CAPT, if the scan value length is zeros, the the To-position must also be specified with the From-position in order to determine how much data to capture.
  -   Dynamic Variables are handled the same as typed scan values. The scan program first replaces a Dynamic Variable token with the variable's value at run time, then it subjects the scan value to the scan value length, as described above for specific values. Leave the scan value length at zero to allow the scan program to adapt to the actual length of the Dynamic Variable's value at run time. If a scan value length is specified, then the possible values of the Dynamic Variable must be well understood in advance in order to predict the results of the SCANSPLF match rules.
- Bypass parm value: This field is used only when the SCANSPLF command will provide input values in its PARAMETERS keyword. If the specified bypass value is found in the input PARAMETERS position corresponding to this scan rule sequence number, then the input parameter will be considered matched by default and the report will not actually be scanned in order to set this scan rule to a status of matched.
:::note Example
For a given application, such as a financial report balancing task, the SCANSPLF command might be assembled by an automatic routine executing on the OpCon/xps server. In this example, assume that there are four input parameter values: debit item count, debit total amount, credit item count, credit total amount. If any of these values is not found in the source data used by the SCANSPLF command assembly routine, then that routine is allowed to insert a place-holder value that indicates, "thisvalue is not supplied today - ignore this parameter position." An example of such a value might be *empty*. In this case, the Bypass parm value should be set to this same value, *empty*. To make the bypass value work, the administrator configuring the LSAM SPLF Scan Rules must coordinate this special value with the programmer responsible for building the automated routines that will assemble the SCANSPLF command string for the OpCon/xps job. 
- Bypass value length: Optionally, specify the length of the characters string used for the Bypass parm value. If this length is left at zeros, the scan program will assume that the Bypass parm value length ends with the last non-blank character. Leaving this value as zeros is the usual practice.
- Compress numeric: This flag field tells the LSAM data comparison rule engine how to handle the comparison data and the captured data. If numeric data was edited using a currency sign and decimal point, it may be preferable to match the whole character string exactly, without compression. But if the absolute numeric value is important and the numeric field editing cannot be predicted, then it may work better to compress out all non-numeric characters and compare only the numeric digits.  Compressed monomeric do not keep track of how many digits fall to the right of the decimal point, so it is important that the number of decimal places be the same in both the reference value (which may be an input PARAMETER from the SCANSPLF command) and the scan value found in the report when the option for compressing numeric data will be used. 
- Required rule: 
  -   This field is used to indicate that a scan rule is required, and it will affect the pass/fail outcome of the scan task:
  -   Y = yes, the rule must be matched as part of the overall outcome of the SCANSPLF job.
  -   N = no, this rule may be ignored; whether it matches or not, it does not affect the overall outcome of the SCANSPLF job.                
  -   This field MUST be set to Y when the scan value is *PARM.
  -   This rule at the individual scan rule level must be coordinated with the SCANSPLF command setting in its FAILOPT (fail option) keyword. The scan program itself keeps track of all rules that have their "Required rule" field set to Y=yes. At the end of the scan job, if all required rules were matched, then the SCANSPLF command would end normally. If any of the required rules were not matched, then the SCANSPLF command would end abnormally. The SCANSPLF command FAILOPT can be used to reverse the logic of this outcome (or to ignore the pass/fail outcome of rule matching). If the FAILOPT is set to (2) = fail on match, then the SCANSPLF command  will signal a failure only when all required rules are matched. For FAILOPT(2), if any required scan rule is not matched, the SCANSPLF command will appear to end     normally.
  -   The FAILOPT(2) technique may be most useful for single-rule Applications. For example, if the Application is searching for a failure message in a job log report, finding a match for any one failure message should generate an abnormal end of the SCANSPLF command. If two different failure message rules were specified, it is unlikely that both failure messages would be found, therefore, the SCANSPLF using FAILOPT(2) would typically end normally because not all rules were  matched.

##### Functions

- **F3=Exit**: Return to the LSAM menu.
- **F5=Refresh**: Reload the maintenance display with the original default values for Add, Copy or Change, discarding any new typed input.
- **F8=DynVar**: When the cursor is positioned in the Scan Value field, use this function key to view a window of registered Dynamic Variable values and select a value to be inserted into the Scan Value field.
- **F12=Cancel**: Return to the Work with SPLF Scan Rules list display.
- **PageDown/PageUp**: When the LSAM Utilities Configuration option is set to use the 2-page format for this maintenance display, the PageDown and PageUp keys can be used to move between the two pages.

    fields on page 2. Use PageDown to view the page 2 fields, if desired, before pressing the Enter key.

## Work with Capture Response Rules

- **Screen Title**: Work with Capture Response Rules
- **Screen ID**: OPRR50R1

The same data capture response functions support both Screen data capture for Operator Replay and report data capture for the SCANSPLF utility command. Some of the following description includes information that is useful in distinguishing between the two different types of data capture. Each actual data capture definition and the captured data record are labeled by their Type field, where "C" = screen capture and "S" = spool file capture. The list column headings will change depending on the subset rule that is currently in effect. 

Refer to the How To discussion earlier in this topic for more information about ways to use data capture and captured data response rules.

##### Menu Pathways

Main Menu \> Events and Utilities menu (#3) \> Work with Captured Data Response Rules (#5).

##### Fields
- Subset to Type: When this Work With list has been called directly from the menu, the LSAM menu passes a parameter to signal the program whether the call came from the Operator Replay menu (Type = Screen), or from the Events and Utilities Menu (Type = SCANSPLF). Function key F15 can be used to force a change to the Subtype, or to remove subsetting and show all Response rules of both types.
- Search content: Type a value in this field and press <**Enter**> or <**F16**> to initiate a search for a record that has matching data anywhere in the record, including data that might not appear on the list display (but the matching data would appear in the display of the detail of the record). When <**F16**> is pressed a second time, the search continues from after the last matching record, using the same Search content data. Press <**Enter**> a second time or press <**F5=Refresh**> to start a new search.
- Opt: Type option from list displayed near the top of this screen. Refer to options definitions, below.
- Capture ID (APP): A label that groups together all of the data capture rules that apply to a single SCANSPLF Scan Rule (or to an Operator Replay script Sequence number). In the SCANSPLF command, the Capture ID is known as the Application.
- SEQ: The sequence of the source Application Scan Rule (or Operator Replay data capture rule). This number determines the order in which spool file scan rules (or  Operator Replay data capture rules) are executed. The effect of this sequence number is that it imposes a higher level of control over the sequence of response rules, and the Response Sequence number (below) operates within this higher level.
- T: Type: C = Operator Replay screen data capture, S = SCANSPLF Scan Rule data capture.
- RS#: Response Sequence Number: The order in which each response rule will be executed (that is, within the higher order data capture SEQuence order).
- SplFName: Spool File Name: When the Response Rule Type is S, this column shows the Spool File Name assigned to the SCANSPLF Scan Rule to which this response is attached.
- SplF #: 
  - Spool File Number: When the Response Rule Type is S, this column shows the Spool File Number assigned to the SCANSPLF Scan Rule to which this response
is attached.
  - The Spool File Number is actually an attribute of a spool file after it is produced by the Job Name (next field in table), but this column becomes the Operator Replay Script Step Number when the Type is C.
- SplFJobName:
  - Spool file Job Name: When the Response Rule Type is S, this column shows the Job Name value assigned to the SCANSPLF Scan Rule.
  - (This column is not used for Operator Replay Script Steps, Type C.)
- Command: The command text (first few characters shown) that will be executed in response to captured data, if the comparison data rule qualifies. (Use option 5=Display to view the comparison data rule.)

##### Functions

- **F3=Exit**: Return to the LSAM menu.
- **F5=Refresh**: Reload the list display with the latest data from the master file.
- **F6=Add**: Branch to the screen for creating a new Capture Response Rule record.
- **F12=Cancel**: Return to the LSAM menu.
- **F15=Subset**: When this program was called directly from the LSAM menu, this function key appears, permitting a change to the type of Response rule appearing in the list. The Subset window offers a choice of Type C = screen capture response rules, or S = SCANSPLF data capture response rules.
- **F16=Search next**: When a search argument has been entered in the Search content field, pressing F16 can either start a new search (if the content value was changed) or it can continue a search to look for the next list entry that matches the search argument, starting with the first record after the last match found.
- **F17=Top**: Reposition the list display to show the first record in the list.
- **F18=Bottom**: Reposition the list display to show the last record in the list.
- **F24=More keys**: Change the function key line to show additional supported keys.

##### Options

- **2=Change**: To change a record, type 2 in the Opt field next to the record(s). Press <**Enter**> to proceed to the Change detail screen.
- **3=Copy**: To copy a record, type 3 in the Opt field next to the record. Press <**Enter**> to proceed to the Copy detail screen.
- **4=Delete**: To delete one or more records, type 4 next to each record. Press <**Enter**> to proceed to the Delete confirmation
    window.
- **5=Display**: To display record details, type 5 next to each record. Press <**Enter**> to proceed to the display details screen. Typing option 5 next to many or all records at once before pressing <**Enter**> is a convenient way to review all the definition details at once. Press <**Enter**> to advance as each detail screen is presented.

### Add/Change/Copy Capture Response Rules

- **Screen Title**: Copy Capture Response Rule
- **Screen ID**: OPRR50R2

Refer to the How To discussion earlier in this topic for more information about the meaning and purpose of the fields on this display, especially how the Continuation field works.

##### Menu Pathways

Main Menu \> Events and Utilities menu (#3) \> Work with Captured Data Response Rules (#5) \> F6=Add **- or -** option 2=Change **- or -** option 3=Copy.

##### Fields

- From fields (Resp Seq): When this screen appears in Copy mode, the key fields of the source record being copied are shown in this heading area. When this program is called from the Operator Replay Sequence maintenance, only the Response Sequence appears in the From field list. A new value must be assigned to the new Response Rule record being created in Copy mode, using the Response Sequence input field (below).
- Capture Identifier: A label that groups together all of the data capture rules that apply to a single Operator Replay script Sequence number. For Copy and Change operations, this key field is protected from update. This field and the Capture Seq field (next) identify the rule to which this response record will react.
- Seq: The sequence of the data capture rule to which this response will react. For Copy and Change operations, this key field is protected from update. This number determines the order in which data capture rules are executed.
- Type: Type: C = screen capture, S = SCANSPLF data capture. This must be the type of the data capture definition. For Copy and Change operations, this field is protected from update.
- Response sequence: Response Sequence Number: The order in which each response rule will be executed. When changing an existing rule's sequence number, pay close attention to the Continuation field value, because the order of records is critical when the Continuation field is used to group multiple response qualifications (using Compare data) and commands.
- Continuation: 
  -   Continuation field values  are: blanks, CMD, AND, OR. 
  -   A value that supports multiple groups of commands and/or rules that may be qualified for execution in response to a single record of captured data. In summary, the values work like this:
  -   blank = Starts a new group of comparison rules and commands, separate and unrelated from other rules groups. 
  -   OR = an exclusive OR, meaning that the next comparison rule or group of rules may qualify a response command group if the previous rule group did not qualify.
  -   AND = connects more than one qualification rule into a single group.
  -   CMD = an additional rules record is providing an additional response command to execute, associated with the qualification rules of the comparison record or     group of records immediately preceding this record. This continuation record will be ignored for comparison rules, it exists only to support multiple commands that are part of a single response group.
  -   (For more information on this field and examples, refer to the How To discussion above.) 
- Compress numeric: This flag field tells the LSAM data comparison rule engine how to handle the comparison data and the captured data. If numeric data was edited using a currency sign and decimal point, it may be preferable to match the whole character string exactly, without compression. But if the absolute numeric value is important and the numeric field editing cannot be predicted, then it may work better to compress out all non-numeric characters and compare only the numeric digits. Compressed numeric values do not keep track of how many digits fall to the right of the decimal point, so it is important that the number of decimal places be the same in both the captured data and the comparison data when the option for compressing numeric data will be used.
:::note
The setting of this flag also controls how captured data will be stored into a DynamicVariable, if one is named in the field below.
:::
- Store CAPT to-> DynVar: 
  - Typing a name into this field causes the captured data response rule module to create or update an LSAM Dynamic Variable in the LSAM table using the value of the captured data. This field is limited to only type-V (general use) Dynamic Variables. The LSAM command SETDYNVAR is executed by the response rules module to support this field.
  -  This variable value is set before the response command is processed, meaning that the response command can use the same dynamic variable name in order to have
access to the currently captured value.
  :::note
  The format of the captured data that is stored in the Dynamic Variable is affected by the Compress numeric option, above.
  :::
  - (To create or update a type-L Dynamic Variable, insert a SETDYNVAR command into the response command line. This could be done on a separate response rule record that is associated with the same SPLF Scan Rule or Operator Replay screen capture rule.)
- Store CAPT to> Oper Rply Var (Operator Replay Variable): 
  - Typing a name into this field causes the captured data response rule module to create or update an LSAM Operator Replay token variable in the LSAM table.
  - When Captured Data Response Rules are associated with an Operator Replay script's Screen Capture Rule, the setting of the Operator Replay token variable value is completed before the script step responds to the current screen on display. This means that the content of the screen can be used to set the variable and the same variable name can then be used in the command line of the script step's response to the screen format.
- Response cmd (part 1); F13=Full CMD: 
  - The first 214 characters of the response command string may be entered in this field. If the command is longer than 214 characters, press <**F13=Full CMD**> to
branch to a screen where a much longer command string may be entered. Function key <**F4=Prompt**> may be used to get IBM i help with command prompting. Unlike the Compare data lines, the entire command string will appear in the F13=Full CMD screen. Be careful if a partial command shows in this field in Change mode; in this case it is recommended that F13=Full CMD be used to be sure that the final command syntax is correct after any changes.
  - Dynamic Variables may be used in place of all or part of the command line syntax. (For more information about Dynamic Variables, refer to Job Tracking and Queuing.)
  - Also refer to the discussion below about how LSAM Event commands can be used in this field, and how OpCon/xps property (variable) tokens can also be supported when an Event command is used. (Any other IBM i command may also be used in this field, but only Event commands are supported for replacing OpCon/xps property tokens.
- Comp reference value: 
  - The compare reference value is a field containing a character string or a reference to a value store in another file, for use in qualifying this Rule for execution. If the referenced value does not match the Compare data according to the Compare rule, then the Capture Response Rule Response command will not be executed.
  - *CAPT = Use the captured data as the reference data (this is the original default for comparing data, in prior versions).
  - DynVar = The LSAM Dynamic Variable named in this field will be compared to the Compare data. (Do not type 'DynVar' but instead type the name of a Dynamic Variable. Use function key F8 to select from a list of existing dynamic variables.) 
  - char = a specific string typed in this field will be compared to the Compare data.
- Comp reference length: Specifies the length of data to be used from the Comp reference value, starting at position 1 of the reference value. If this field is zero, then the trimmed length of the reference value will be used. (Trimming means that any trailing blanks will not be considered, only data from position 1 through the last non-blank character will determine the length of the Comp reference value.)
- Compare rule: 
  - Specifies the type of compare to use between the Comp reference value (which will be factor 1) and the Compare data (which will be factor 2). For example, if GT is specified, then the Comp reference value must be greater than the Compare data in order for this Capture Response Rule to be executed.                 |
  - EQ = equal, NE = not equal, GT = greater than, LT = less than, GE = greater than or equal, LE = less than or equal, ** = contains (as in, the Comp reference value contains the Compare data anywhere within the Comp reference value string).
- Capture length: This is a protected field that shows the length specified for the captured data. The value will appear in Copy and Change mode. In Add (Create) mode, a value will be supplied if the F4=Prompt key is used to select a valid Capture ID and Sequence. Use this field as a reference when defining the Compare data.
- Compare data lines 1- 5; PagDown=6-24 
  - The compare data is used to match with the original capture data according to the compare rule. The compare data may be typed directly into this field. Use
PageDown to show and update lines 6-24; lines 1-5 only appear on the main maintenance screen. Up to 1920 characters may be specified.
  - If it should be desired to compare an entire 24 X 80 screen, that is, all 1920 characters, it would be possible to copy and paste the reference screen image (lines 1-5 separately from lines 6-24) into this field. However, keep in mind that only the displayable characters are compared. That is, field attributes such as color (and any EBCID character value less than X'40') will not be considered; a space character is used in place of non-display values.
  - Special values may be typed into this field, instead of actual compare data:
  - *ANY = No comparison will be performed. A command or group of commands associated with compare data value of *ANY will always be executed.
  - *PARM = Reserved for the SCANSPLF command. This means that the compare data to be used is the same as the parameter value supplied with the SCANSPLF command, except that the Compare rules supplied with this response record will apply. If this value is used with an Operator Replay screen data capture, it has the same effect as *ANY. 
  - DynVar = This prompting value indicates that one or more Dynamic Variable tokens may be typed into the Compare data lines. DO NOT TYPE "DynVar" into the Compare  data. Instead, type the Dynamic Variable token syntax, which by default looks like this: {dyn_var_name}
  - One or more dynamic variables may be typed along with other actual compare data. When the response rule is qualified for execution, the dynamic variable value will be retrieved just before the comparison operation is performed. Keep in mind that the result of replacing a dynamic variable may be longer or shorter than the dynamic variable token. It is important to anticipate the exact length and content of the compare data line(s) as they will look after dynamic variable tokens are replaced. (For more information about Dynamic Variables, refer to [Job Tracking and Queuing](../job-tracking/overview.md).)

##### Functions

- **F3=Exit**: Return to the LSAM menu.
- **F4=Prompt**: When the cursor is positioned in the Capture identifier or Capture sequence fields, a window appears for selecting from a list of available capture identifiers. The contents of the list depends on whether this display is being used for Operator Replay screen data capture, or for SCANSPLF report data capture.
- **F5=Refresh**: Reload the maintenance display with the original default values for Add, Copy or Change, discarding any new typed input.
- **F8=DynVar**: Open a window to select an available Dynamic Variable, for use in the Response Command or the Compare Data fields.
- **F9=Event cmds**: Open a window to select from a list of available LSAM Event commands, to be inserted into the Response Command field after the Event command fields are filled in. (Refer to discussion below about using OpCon property (variable) tokens with Event
    commands.)
- **F12=Cancel**: Return to the Work with Capture Response Rules list display.
- **F13=Full CMD**: Branch to a sub-display that uses the whole screen to show the entire available space for entering long command text strings. Any data entered on the short (part 1) command entry line will be carried forward for display on the full command entry screen. After returning from the full entry screen, the first 214
    characters of the longer command will appear in the short (part 1) Response cmd field.
- **F24=More keys**: Change function key line to show additional supported keys.

#### LSAM Event Commands and OpCon/xps Property Tokens

The response command line supports execution of LSAM Event commands, just like any other IBM i command. But Event commands have additional support. The function key <**F9**> can be used to select from a list of available Event commands and then to have their keyword fields automatically prompted. When an Event command is placed into the response command line, and only for Event commands, the LSAM programs will support embedded OpCon/xps property (variable) tokens.

The feature of including OpCon/xps property tokens in an LSAM Event command is described in complete detail in the topic about Message Management. Look for references to the Event command line of the Message Management Parameter screen. In that topic there is a complete table of the specific OpCon/xps property (variable) token values that can be supported directly by the LSAM itself, if a certain syntax is used. In general, any OpCon/xps property token could be used because the LSAM
passes along the Event command string with the OpCon/xps property tokens in tact, signaling the OpCon/xps server programs to translate the tokens into the values that are stored in the OpCon/xps database.

## Display Captured Data Log

The function for displaying the captured data log is important as an auditing tool. This inquiry provides evidence of the data that was actually captured from either a display screen during an Operator Replay script execution, or from a report line during the use of the SCANSPLF command.

- **Screen Title**: Display Captured Data Log
- **Screen ID**: OPRL40R1

The same data capture response functions support both Screen data capture for Operator Replay and report data capture for the SCANSPLF utility command. Some of the following description includes information that is useful in distinguishing between the two different types of data capture. Each actual data capture definition and the captured data record are labeled by their Type field, where "C" = screen capture, "S" = spool file capture and 'M' = Message data.

Refer to the How To discussions above in this topic for more information about ways to use data capture and captured data response rules.

##### Menu Pathways

Main Menu \> Operator replay menu (#4) \> Display Captured Data log (#8).

##### Fields

-  Subset to Type:   When this list display has been called directly from the menu, the LSAM menu passes a parameter to signal the program whether the call came from the Operator Replay menu (Type = Screen), or from the Events and Utilities Menu (Type = SCANSPLF). Function key F15 can be used to force a change to the Subtype, or to remove subsetting and show all Response rules of both types.
-  Search content:    Type a value in this field and press <**Enter**> or <**F16**> to initiate a search for a record that has matching data anywhere in the record, including data that might not appear on the list display (but the matching data would appear in the display of the detail of the record). When <**F16**> is pressed a second time, the search continues from after the last matching record, using the same Search content data. Press <**Enter**> a second time (with no options typed), or press <**F5=Refresh**> to start a new search.
-  Opt:               Type option from list displayed near the top of this screen. Refer to options definitions, below.
-  Capture ID:        A label that groups together all of the data capture rules that apply to a single Operator Replay script Sequence number. (This field is more important when data capture is used with the SCANSPLF command, and only serves Operator Replay screen capture as a useful means of labeling captured data when it appears in the captured data debug log file list, or when prompting for a Capture ID from Response Rules.)
-  Seq:               The sequence of the data capture rule. This number determines the order in which data capture rules are executed. The effect of this sequence number is more noticeable when there are captured data response rules associated with each data capture definition, in that it imposes a high level of control over the sequence of response rules that might apply to a given screen format (or to a SCANSPLF spool file).
-  MM-DD-HH.MM:       A portion of the time stamp of the log entry, showing the month, day, hours and minutes.
-  T:                 Type: C = screen capture, S = SCANSPLF data capture.
-  Script/SPLF:       The name of the Operator Replay Script, or the name of the spool file that was processed by the SCANSPLF command. The value shown here is defined by the value in the T (Type) field.
-  Number:            For an Operator Replay Script, the Sequence number of the step when the screen data was captured. For a spool file, the spool file number within the job where the spool file was found.
-  JobNbr:            The IBM i Job Number of the job that executed the Operator Replay script or the SCANSPLF command. This number helps to distinguish among list entries that belong to the same, or to different jobs.

##### Functions

- **F3=Exit**: Return to the LSAM menu.
- **F5=Refresh**: Reload the list display with the latest data from the master file.
- **F12=Cancel**: Return to the LSAM menu.
- **F15=Subset**: Supports a change to the type of captured data entries appearing in the list. The Subset window offers a choice of Type C = screen capture response rules, or S = SCANSPLF data capture response rules.
- **F16=Search next**: When a search argument has been entered in the Search content field, pressing F16 can either start a new search (if the content value was changed) or it can continue a search to look for the next list entry that matches the search argument, starting with the first record after the last match found.
- **F17=Top**: Reposition the list display to show the first record in the list.
- **F18=Bottom**: Reposition the list display to show the last record in the list.
- **F24=More keys**: Change the function key line to show additional supported keys.

##### Options

- **5=Display**: To display record details, type 5 next to each record. Press <**Enter**> to proceed to the display details screen. Typing option 5 next to many or all records at once before pressing <**Enter**> is a convenient way to review all the definition details at once. Press <**Enter**> to advance as each detail screen is presented.
- **9=WRKJOB**: Calls the IBM i Work with Job function for the job number that appears in the list. This function can help find output produced by a captured data response rule, or it can help find the spool file that was scanned by the SCANSPLF command.

Main Menu \> Events and Utilities menu (#3) \> Display Captured Data log (#8) \> option 5=Display.

##### Fields

- Log record RRN: This is the relative record number from physical file OPRLOGF40 
- Type:
  - C = Operator Replay screen data capture
  - S = SCANSPLF report spool file scanning 
  - M = Message data capture 
- Capture ID: The identifier assigned to a group of data capture rules. For Captured Message Data, this is the Application ID.
- (Capture) Seq: The sequence number assigned to the data capture definition, representing the order of capture within the Capture ID.
- Page: This field is not used by Operator Replay screen data capture. For the SCANSPLF command, this documents the page of the report where the captured data was found.
- Rpt Line: For the SCANSPLF command, this is the report line, within a page, where data was found and captured.
- Col(-umn): The column within the Row where the data capture started.
- Length: The length of data that was captured, starting at the Row and Col specified. For Operator Replay screen data, up to 1920 characters of displayable data may be captured by a single capture rule. (For display formats larger than 24 X 80, more than one screen capture rule would be required to capture more than 1920 characters of data. For the SCANSPLF command, the capture length is normally limited to 132 characters, or one print line of data.)
- Capture Job ID: The IBM i full job name that made the Captured Data log entry. This is the job that will be shown if the function key F9=WRKJOB is pressed.
- Date: The log file entry date, in CCYYMMDD format. Used to purge the log file, based on the LSAM log file retention days (refer to LSAM Parameters).
- Time stamp: The IBM i system time when the log entry was written.
- SPLF Name: The spool file name scanned by the SCANSPLF command.
- SPLF number: The Spool File Number of the spool file named within the job that qualified for the SCANSPLF command.
- SPLF SrcJob: The name of the job specified for the SCANSPLF command. When the SCANSPLF command was executed by the LSAM for the special purpose of evaluating an OpConrequested job completion status, this field will show a value of '*JORS.'
- Numeric: Y = yes, N = No: Indicates whether numeric data compression was specified for the captured data.
- Rows 1-12: Rows 13-24: 2..5...10....5...20: The row and columns of the capture data are labeled. Press PageDown or PageUp to toggle between the display of rows 1-12 and 13-24. Either eye vision, or manipulation of the cursor may be used to help identify the exact column for each character of captured data, based on the numbered ruler line just above the first line of captured data. The ruler starts with number 2 and ends with number 78 (due to 5250 workstation display constraints), however, the actual captured data occupies columns 1 to 80 on the lines below the ruler. Thus, workstations that display the column location of the cursor should match the character location in the ruler line.

##### Functions

- **PageDown/Up**: Use the PageDown and PageUp function keys to toggle the display of captured data between lines 1-12 and 13-24.
- **F3=Exit**: Return to the LSAM menu.
- **F9=WRKJOB**: Branch to the IBM i Work with job menu, to display detailed information about the IBM i Job ID named in the display panel.
- **F12=Cancel**: Return to the list of log entries.

## Display Data Capture Debug Log

The function is not documented in detail because it is meant for use by trained analysts or programmers already familiar with the operation of the Capture Data and Capture Response Rules programs. The log entries that may be observed in this display may seem apparent to users familiar with data capture and response.

LSAM menu 3. Events and Utilities Menu, contains option 7. LSAM Utility configuration, where a flag may be set to turn on debug logging for allof the LSAM data capture and captured data response actions. This debug logging supports both Operator Replay screen data capture as well as the SCANSPLF command. The debug log entries would prove exactly when the system captured data, when it processed Dynamic Variables and which response rules were executed.

The debugging feature could be turned off for better performance in systems that do not require extensive audit logging or debugging of any problems. On the other hand, debug logging should be turned on when extensive system audit support is required, because the debug log provides detailed evidence of all automated operations.

If technical support is needed for apparent problems with either capturing data or executing response rules, turn on the debug function in LSAM menu 3. After attempting execution of the Operator Replay script, or the SCANSPLF command that is causing trouble, use the SMASUP log file extract command to retrieve the debug log information and send the resulting save file from library SMALOG to SMA Support for assistance. (Refer to [Operation of Extracting LSAM Log and Master Files](../logs-database/extracting.md) for more information about how to use the SMASUP command.)

Following is a table of Entry_Code values that may be observed in the list of debug log entries. These entry labels help to identify the action that was performed and/or the result of data capture and captured data response rules. Some of the codes reflect a failure in which case the log entry will appear red in color.

##### Entry_Code Value Appearing in Captured Data Debug Log Viewer

**SCANSPLF command log entries**                
- SCANSPLFST: The SCANSPLF command has started its function.
- SCAN_PARMS: The PARAMETERS keyword value string sent to the program by the SCANSPLF command.                 
- PARM_COUNT: A log entry indicating the number of scan values  found in the input parameter after parsing the PARAMETERS keyword value of the SCANSPLF command. This entry may show that no input scan values were submitted, but that the program will continue to use any registered scan values found in the SPLF Scan Rules table.
- PARSE_PARM: A log entry showing how the results after scanning the PARAMETERS keyword value of input scan values. The details entry shows the contents of the array where the input scan values are divided into even-spaced locations.
- SCANSPLFOC: A separate "occurrence" or group of Scan Rules is set up for each unique SPLF + Job Name + SPLF Number found among the rules under a single Application code. This log entry documents each unique set of Scan Rule keys that is found in the rules file for a job.
- NoRulR: SCANSPLF command has found no required rules among the Scan Rules for this Application (possibly also limited to a specific Spool File and/or Job Name, SPLNBR).
- SCANSPLF_J: A log entry showing information about the actual job selected while searching for the target spool file.
- SCANSPLF_F: A log entry showing information about the actual spool file (report) found for scanning.

- SCAN_NOMCH: A log entry showing one of the required scan values that was not matched in the scanned report.
- SCAN_BYPAS: A scan value bypass rule registered in the SPLF Scan Rules table was found and recognized. This scan value will be marked as matched, even though bypassed. 
- SCANSPLF_E: A fatal error was encountered and the SCANSPLF command has not completed its function. Refer to the log entry detail for a status code and more information about the reason for the failure. 
- SCAN_PASS: A successful match of all required scan values; the SCANSPLF command ends normally. 
- SCAN_FAIL: Not all required scan values were matched; the SCANSPLF ends abnormally and, if started by OpCon/xps, a list of mismatched values is sent to the OpCon/xps job information. 
- SCANSPLFEN: Marks the normal end of the SCANSPLF command. A final completion status code may be found in the details of this log entry. 
- SCAN_ABEND: 
  - The SCANSPLF command processor has reported a failure.
  - If this failure was unexpected, the abnormal termination code is found in the log entry details.
  - This entry may also reflect the program's intentional forced abnormal termination due to the combination of the FAILOPT command parameter and the set of required Scan Rules that were executed. 
- SCAN_LOG: A program debug entry providing non-critical, general information about conditions detected by the SCANSPLFR program. Refer to the entry details for more information. 
- SCAN_MATCH: A log entry registering a matched scan value.
- SCAN_LBLNO: An indicated scan label was found, but the associated value after the label did not match the supplied scan reference value. 
- FAIL_1, FAIL_2, FAIL_4, FAIL_5:
  -   Logs a record of the fact that the final result of a SCANSPLF execution was controlled by the FAILOPT parameter set to a value of 1 - 5, indicating that required rules were either matched or not matched and that this condition was interpreted as requiring a forced task failure.
  -   These same log entry values are also used by the SCANOUTQ command, reflecting the evaluation of all executed SCANSPLF commands.
- PASS_1, PASS_2, PASS_3, PASS_4, PASS_5:
  -   Logs a record of the fact that the final result of a SCANSPLF execution was controlled by the FAILOPT parameter set to a value of 1 - 5, indicating that required rules were matched, not matched or ignored, and that this condition was interpreted as requiring the task to end normally. 
  -   These same log entry values are also used by the SCANOUTQ command, reflecting the evaluation of all executed SCANSPLF commands.
- SCANOUTQST: The SCANOUTQ command has started a new task, using the command parameters reported in this log entry. 
- SCANOUTQPA: A log entry listing the contents of the command PARAMETERS keyword. This value set is simply passed along to each execution of the SCANSPLF 
command.
- SCANOUTQ_E: The command has detected an illogical condition or program error that prevents the task from being completed. Refer to the log entry for an explanation.
- SCANOUTQ_S: A log entry recording the syntax of each SCANSPLF command to be executed. 
- SCANOUTQ_F: This entry records the final failed (abnormal) completion status of a SCANSPLF command. 
- SCANOUTQ_P: This entry records the final passed (normal) completion status of a SCANSPLF command. 
- SCANOUTQ_L: A general log entry made by the SCANOUTQ command, including information such as the replacement of a Dynamic Variable.
- SCANOUTQEN: This entry marks the normal end of the SCANOUTQ command. The log entry may also provide a completion status code.
- SCANOUTQAB: 
  -   This entry marks the final abnormal completion of the SCANOUTQ command.
  -   The command may have forced the abnormal end according to the FAILOUTQ parameter flag setting, based on the results of all SCANSPLF commands executed.
  -   Refer to previous entries for indication of a program failure, meaning that the command could not complete its entire task.

**Operator Replay script entries for data capture operations**
- CAPTDATA: A log entry recording the data captured from a screen image.
- CAPTERR: A log entry reporting a program error code encountered while attempting to capture screen data. Refer to the log entry details for the exact error message that was trapped.

**Message Data entries for data capture operations**    
- M_MSG_BUF: The log entry shows the message data buffer used for data capture. The buffer may contain only the primary message text, only the secondary (Help) message text, or both text types concatenated with one space character between them.   
- M_CAPTURE: The log entry shows the portion of data that was captured from the message text buffer. This data would be referred to, for example, when the 
special value of \*CAPT is used in a Captured Data Response Rule.
- M_CAPTRSPE: An error occurred during the attempt to process Captured Data Response Rules after some Message Data was captured.
- M_DYNV_ERR: A Dynamic Variable token could not be replaced during the processing of Message Data capture. 
- M_DYNV_PRE: During Message Data capture, the string that contains a Dynamic Variable token before the token is replaced. This is the string that contains an optional Scan Label that will be used to identify the message data desired for capture.
- M_DYNV_RPL: During Message Data capture, the string value after a Dynamic Variable token was replaced. 

**Common entries for Captured Data Response Rule processing**
