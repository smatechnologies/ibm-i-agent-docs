# External Events

"External Events" is the OpCon term that identifies the specifically formatted command strings that OpCon Agents and other authorized users are permitted to transmit to the OpCon central application server.  External Event commands address many categories of actions, for example, adding or changing a job in a schedule, or initiating an email message that the OpCon server will transmit to inside or outside of the OpCon network.

## Setting Up an Event User ID and Password

To enable the IBM i Agent to successfully submit External Event commands it is necessary to first assign an OpCon user, within the OpCon server administration, that has authority to execute External Event commands.  The user must be allowed to work with IBM i machines.  There is a separate password or (more recently) an authority token that must be generated for the OpCon user's permission for External Events.  The password or token is different from the OpCon user's primary password or token used to access an OpCon user interface.  The password or token must be captured (copied) immediately so that it can be pasted into the IBM i Agent's "External Event Token" storage, using the LSAM sub-menu 3, option 2.

### Registering an Event User ID and Password

After using OpCon User administration to generate a password or token for an IBM i User, the password or token must have been copied immediately as it was generated so that the value can be registered within the IBM i Agent's database.  The following procedure stores the password or token in an encrypted format, for internal use by the Agent's automation routines.

1. In the command line, enter **SMAGPL/STRSMA**. For more information on STRSMA command parameters, refer to the [STRSMA Command](../operations/lsam.md#the-strsma-command).
2. Enter **3** to choose the **Event management** menu in the SMA Main Menu.
3. Enter **2** to choose the **External Event Token** option in the Event Menu.
4. A dedicated form of the Agent's User Management registration program allows only one External Event User ID to be registered.  
  - If an External Event User has not yet been registered, it can be added.
  - If an External Event User is already registered, it can have its description and token (or password) udpated.
4. For new registrations, enter the registered OpCon External Event User name.
5. <**Tab**\> to the **Token** field and paste in the token (or password) value copied from the OpCon User Administration process.
6. <**Tab**\> to second **Token** field and paste in the same token value to confirms it to the program edit process.
7. Press <**Enter**> to complete the addition or change.

## External Event Command Syntax: CSV vs. XML

The IBM i Agent now supports both the original CSV (Comma-separated values) syntax, and also the newer XML formats. The XML format is preferred because it does not constrain the content of Event command parameters.  By comparison, the CSV format prevents the use of a comma within any Event command parameter, causing issues expecially with the $NOTIFY:EMAIL command's message text parameter.  The Agent's master file data entry screens give the user the ability to convert existing CSV External Event Commands to XML External Event Commands with the press of a function key.

## CPYTOMSGIN
This External Event Interface command allows a user program to directly pass OpCon events to the SAM and supporting services (SAM-SS).  While the IBM i Agent supports an array of IBM i styled commands (listed above) for each of the OpCon External Events, the CPYTOMSGIN command offers convenient support for configuring External Event commands within the Agent's various automation tools.  One of the advantages of this Event command wrapper utility is that it can recognize and replace Dynamic Variable {TOKENS} within any part of the submitted External Event command before the actual Event command is sent to the OpCon server.

### Using CPYTOMSGIN
Copy to message input: This is an IBM i LSAM imitation of the similar function available on the OpCon server. CPYTOMSGIN may be used to generate any OpCon Event command, especially those that are not supported by individual LSAM commands.

The CPYTOMSGIN utility forwards external events to SAM and supporting services (SAM-SS). This utility can be executed within an IBM i batch job that is scheduled by OpCon, or it can be executed from virtually anywhere within the IBM i environment, wherever IBM i command execution is supported. The CPYTOMSGIN command is supported by a driver program that automatically allocates the IBM i LSAM libraries and other resources needed to complete its task. When it is executed from outside of the LSAM library list, qualify the command with its library location, as in the example below.

Another important capability of the CPYTOMSGIN command is that it will support translation of IBM i LSAM Dynamic Variable tokens that may be included anywhere within the CPYMSGIN parameter, that is, within the actual Event command line.

The syntax for Event commands that are not represented by individual IBM i LSAM commands may be viewed when the CPYTOMSGIN command is selected from the LSAM's menu-driven Event Management function (LSAM menu 3, option 1). The automatic prompting of Event command syntax that occurs when CPYTOMSGIN is selected and a sub-menu of available commands appears results in a final command prompting screen that will contain the model syntax for each OpCon Event command. This model syntax could be copied from the prompt screen and then pasted into the MESSAGE parameter of the CPYTOMSGIN command whenever it is being coded in a user-defined program.

#### Specialized Support for XML-formatted External Event Commands

From the same LSAM sub-menu 3, option 1, an intial display supports user selection of working with the newer and more flexible XML-formatted External Event commands.  The XML-formatted commands are best supported, in most cases, by prompting for and selecting one of the series of Agent commands whose names begin with "X", such as XNTYEMAIL which offers and improved way to generate email messages, as compared to the CSV-formatted command $NOTIFY:EMAIL.

For XML-formatted Event commands, the CPYTOMSGIN command is usually not needed or recommended.  But there are some exceptional circumstances where detailed control over the parameters of XML-formatted commands (such as using Dynamic Variable {TOKENS} to supply command parameter values) are best supported by working with the raw, XML <TAGS\>.  For this purpose, the Agent automation tools that support prompting lists of XML Event commands also show the CPYTOMSGIN command.  Select this command to next view a list of available XML Event command names.  After choosing one of the commands, the Agent will present the CPYTOMSGIN command wrapper, surrounding the raw formatted XML commands.  When this format of Event command request is inserted into an Agent automation tool (such as Multi-Step Script job Step records, or the Captured Data Response Rule command lines) it becomes possible to prompt for and insert Dynamic Variable {TOKENS} that will supply one or more Event command parameter values between pairs of XML <TAGS\> at run time.

### Example Program Using CPYTOMSGIN with CSV-format Event commands

:::info Example 
A sample Control Language program follows:
```
00010 PGM
00020 SMAGPL/CPYTOMSGIN CPYMSGIN($NOTIFY:LOG,<Severity>,<EventID>,<Message>)
00030 ENDPGM
```
:::

In the example above, the < > characters are used only to mark the locations where field names are identified. Both the field name and the < > characters must be replaced by the required parameter value. If the specified Event command allows that a field is optional and the value will be left out of the command, the commas that delimit the field position must still be retained. Two consecutive commas with no value between them tells OpCon that the null value should be assigned to the field in that position.

### Example of Using CPYTOMSGIN with XML-format Event commands

:::info Example 
A sample of the CPYTOMSGIN command supporting Dynamic Variable tokens for an XML Event:
```
 Command  . . . . : CPYTOMSGIN CPYMSGIN('<EVENT><TYPE>CONSOLE</TYPE><ACTION>
 DISPLAY</ACTION><MSG>'My message is {DVMSGTEXT}'</MSG></EVENT>')                                 
```
There is another example, just below, of using an Agent Dynamic Variable token to send a value to an OpCon Property.
:::

In the example above, Agent prompting for Event commands was used to select the CPYTOMSGIN command from the initial prompting list of XML commands.  Then the Agent offered a second prompting list of just the XML Event commands so that the XCONDSP command could be selected.  But as the results of this layered prompting were returned to the Agent function data entry, the CPYTOMSGIN command was formatted to include the raw XML <TAGS\>, which allows the user to then prompt for, or type, a Dynamic Variable {TOKEN} into any of the Event command parameters.  The Agent processing of the CPYTOMSGIN command scans the whole command for any Dynamic Variable tokens, and these are replaced by the token's current value at run time before the whole XML-formatted Event command string is transmitted to the OpCon server.

### Application Example: Sending IBM i values to OpCon Properties

IBM i values can be sent to OpCon Properties using the $PROPERTY:SET CSV-format Event command, or the XML-format command XPROPSET, from anywhere that the IBM i LSAM supports OpCon Events. OpCon Property tokens can then be used to reference these IBM i values as part of OpCon automation, wherever Property tokens are supported. 

The CPYTOMSGIN command provides excellent flexibility for the purpose of sending any value retrieved from the IBM i system to be stored in an OpCon Property. When the CPYTOMSGIN command is used, the command driver program will scan the entire external event command string looking for any IBM i LSAM Dynamic Variable tokens that might be replaced. It is very common to put an LSAM Dynamic Variable token into the value parameter of the OpCon $PROPERTY:SET command, so that any value retrieved by, or stored in a Dynamic Variable can be sent up to the OpCon server and stored into an OpCon Property.
:::tip
Remember that the XML-formatted External Event commands can be specified in their raw format and sent to the OpCon server by enclosing them in the Agent's CPYTOMSGIN command, as illustrated above in this document.
:::

Remember that OpCon Property names could be global properties, or they could be instance-qualified properties, possibly qualified to a specific schedule name or an OpCon job name within a schedule. It's possible to use Dynamic Variables to represent the OpCon schedule or job names. As well, within the LSAM automation tools, such as Message Management Parameters or their attached Response Rules, it is also possible to use one of the available $-System variable values identified a table in [Message Management Screens and Windows](../message-management/screens.md#-system-variables-supported-in-event-commands).

Here is an example of pushing the value from an IBM i LSAM Dynamic Variable up to an OpCon global property:

:::info Example 
Sending an IBM i value to an OpCon Property using CSV-formatted Event
```
CPYTOMSGIN CPYMSGIN('$PROPERTY:SET,my_opcon_property,{DISKPERCNT}')
```
Sending an IBM i value to an OpCon Property using XML-formatted Event
```
XPROPSET PROPNAME('OPCON_PROPERTY_NAME') PROPVALUE('{DISKPERCENT}')
```
:::

The example above assumes that the Dynamic Variable DISKPERCNT would previously have been loaded with the current IBM i disk utilization percentage, as would be possible from an Operator Replay script using a screen data Capture Application, linked to a Response Rule that stored the captured data into the Dynamic Variable.

Dynamic Variables are called "dynamic" because they can do more than just store static values. It's possible to assign a user-defined program to a Dynamic Variable master record that can perform any kind of calculation at run-time and return the value that will be used to replace the Dynamic Variable token.

The LSAM software includes both a pre-compiled SQL utility program and a model Control Language program that can be adapted as one of these Dynamic Variable user-defined programs, so that any Field value from an IBM i DB2 database file can be fetched as the Dynamic Variable at run time. The field value can also be trimmed down to use any part of the field value as the replacement for the Dynamic Variable token. The same model CL program also illustrates how to fetch a partial or complete value from an IBM i DB2 data area.

### CPYTOMSGIN Command Prompting Window

The general-purpose Event command CPYTOMSGIN is supported by an additional prompting window that lists all available OpCon Event commands.  This type of prompting the CPYTOMSGIN command is supported from within Agent automation tool master file maintenance displays.

The External Event Command prompting window supports function keys that help with choosing between CSV (Comma Separated Values) and XML (Extensible Markup Language) command formatting.  The XML format is recommended for any commands that have parameters which would benefit from being able to include commas within their data, such as the NOTIFY:EMAIL Event Command ($NOTIFY:EMAIL versus XNTYEMAIL).

#### Fields

- **Event**:         The OpCon Event to be generated.
- **Description**:   A description of the action that is performed by the OpCon Event.

#### Functions

- **F2=Switch format**: Press F2 to switch the prompt window list display between XML and CSV formatted commands.
- **F10=Raw XML format**: When XML format commands are listed, position the cursor to the desired command and press **F10** to return just the raw XML command string back to the master file maintenance display field.
  - **NOTE**: In most cases a raw XML-formatted Event command must be sent through the Agent's communications program to the OpCon server by using the CPYTOMSGIN wrapper commmand.  This is because the raw XML command syntax does not engage the LSAM operations required to queue and forward External Event commands through the TCP/IP communications link with the OpCon server.  In contrast, the IBM-formatted XML Event command shells such as XNTYEMAIL do engage the LSAM-OpCon communications protocol.  Raw XML command syntax is normally only useful when it is (rarely) necessary to insert a long, qualifying key string as part of a multi-instance Dynamic Variable token, into one of the XML command tagged fields.
- **F12=Cancel**: Quits the prompt window and returns to the Trapped Messages Parameters window without completing any updates.
- **Enter**: Pressing the **Enter** key after selecting the CPYTOMSGIN command from the initial prompting window causes a second prompting window to appear that supports selecting either a CSV external event command template string, or else one of the LSAM's IBM-style commands that are used to format an XML event command.

In the XML syntax model illustrated above do not remove the XML \<TAGS\> that surround the value positions. The example above shows that the TYPE and ACTION tags have the required values for the selected XCONDSP command, but that the MSG tags should be filled in with a message text string. If a field value is allowed to be left out of any particular command, the comma that marked that field location must still be retained. In this case, two consecutive commas would indicate to OpCon that the null value should be applied to that field.

In the CSV syntax model illustrated above, the < > characters are used only to mark the description of each field. When the actual data is typed in place of the field description, the < > characters must be removed, just as the field description must also be removed. However,
the commas are a critical part of the command syntax. If a field value is allowed to be left out of any particular command, the comma that marked that field location must still be retained. In this case, two consecutive commas would indicate to OpCon that the null value should be applied to that field.

#### Completing Prompted Event Command Insertion

Press <**Enter**> after the command has been modified (if desired) to cause the final command format for CPYTOMSGIN to be inserted into the Agent master file maintenance display field. The command syntax may still be modified, once it has been inserted into the Event command
field.  This means that other types of prompting, such as inserting Dynamic Variable {TOKENS} or a $-System Variable string, can be accomplished after the Event command is in place.

:::tip
When selecting an XML format Event command from the initial prompt window, using **F10** to select an X* command produces the same CPYTOMSGIN command wrapper syntax as when the CPYTOMSGIN command is selected.  The CPYTOMSGIN command is redundant within the prompting window that lists XML commands, but it was included for convenience so that the XML command processing could work and feel the same as the CSV command prompting has always worked.
:::

### Event Command Prompting

Aside from the CPYTOMSGIN prompting sequence, the IBM i LSAM offers two sets of IBM i styled commands that represent most of the External Event Commands supported within the OpCon server.  These commands can be prompted conveniently only from within an Agent master file data entry function, or from the LSAM menu 3, option 1, where all supported Event commands are listed and are available for test executions.

Here are the constraints when using the individual External Event Commands:
- Prompting of these commands only works when the workstation session is using the LSAM library list.
- Execution of these commands only works when the job is using the LSAM library list.
  - It is possible for any IBM i job to use the LSAM command SMAGPL/SMAADDLIBL to modify the library list just before using an External Event Command.
  - Following execution of the Event command, it is possible to use the LSAM command SMAGPL/SMARMVLIBL to remove the LSAM libraries from the job's library list and restore its former state.

:::tip
SMA recommends that any uses of the LSAM External Event commands from outside of the LSAM library list is more easily supported by enclosing the Event command within the LSAM command SMAGPL/CPYTOMSGIN.  This command is able to manage the LSAM library list during execution of the command, based on the LSAM environment associated with the actual name of the SMAGPL library, or based on settings of this wrapper commands's ENV( ) and GPL( ) parameters:

    SMAGPLTST/CPYTOMSGIN CPYMSGIN('XCONDSP MESSAGE(''message text'')') ENV(TESTLSAM) GPL(SMAGPLTST)

:::

Following are examples of prompted LSAM External Event commands, when they are used within an LSAM environment.

#### Event Command Prompting Window (CSV)
```                      
                      LSAM EVENTS:Console display (CONDSP)

                                                                         Bottom

 F24=More keys  

 ENTER --->

 After entering message text, the final command syntax from this prompted command appears as:

    CONDSP MESSAGE('message text')

 ```

Many of the CSV-supported commands are outdated.  They were generally not recommended for use.  Some of the commands have parameters that are limited in size to fewer characters than are currently supported by the OpCon server.  However, they can still be used as long as they appear to function correctly.  SMA advises to use the CPYTOMSGIN command prompting, outlined above, when preparing CSV-format External Event commands.  Remember, also, that the CPYTOMSGIN command supports embedded Dynamic Variable {TOKENS}, no matter where it is used.

 ENTER --->

 After entering message text, the final command syntax from this prompted command appears as:

    XCONDSP MESSAGE('message text')

 ```

For any special cases when the LSAM's prepared XML Event commands need special attention, the work-around solution is to embed the raw XML format of the Event command within the CPYTOMSGIN command's CPYMSGIN parameter.  The raw XML format has the advantage of supporting, for example, a very long (rarely used) multi-instance Dynamic Variable token that requires an instance-qualifying key values string.

## Events Screens and Windows

### LSAEVTR02-0 - Event Management: Select format

LSAM sub-menu 3, option 1, supports testing and exploring the configuration of all available External Event commands.  When the menu option is selected, an initial screen allows the user to select between 1. XML External Event Commands or 2. CSV External Event Commands.

#### Fields
- **Selection entry**: Type a number from the list of options and press <**Enter**> to view Event commnands in the chosen format.

#### Functions
- **F3=Exit**: Quits the list and returns to the menu.
- **F12=Cancel**: Quits the list and returns to the menu.

#### Menu Pathways
- Main Menu > Events and Utilities (#3) > External Management (#1) 

### LSAEVTR02 - Event Management: List display

A list of Event commands is offered for manual testing of the commands. An External Event command can be selected from the list to (1) explore and optionally copy the format of a command, an (2) to intiate a live test of a command.  Following the prompted command data entry, pressing <**Enter**> will cause that command to be sent by the Agent to the OpCon server.  

One common use of this function is to verify that the External Event User and Token are properly registered. The XCONDSP (or CSV: CONDSP) command is recommended for simple connection test since it sends an obvious message to the SAM log that can be viewed from the OpCon user interface.

#### Menu Pathways

Main Menu > Events and Utilities (#3) > External Management (#1) > (#1) XML - Event Commands, or (#2) CSV - Event Commands.

#### Fields

**Selection**: Enter an Option number or the Command name to select an event.

:::tip
The option numbers are not assigned to Command names on a permanent basis. SMA may update the available list of Event Commands, which makes the Option number subject to change. This number is a sequential number that is assigned to each line at the time the information is assembled for display. If planning to use Operator Replay to select a command from this list, always specify the Command name instead of the Option number, otherwise it is necessary to go back and update the Operator Replay Scripts whenever the Event Command list is updated by SMA.
:::

#### Functions

- **F3=Exit**: Quits the Events list and returns to the menu.
- **F12=Cancel**: Quits the Events list and returns to the menu.
- **F17=Subset**: Requests the Subset window to either establish or remove a subset rule that limits the commands on display according to their Command Type.

### Event Management: Windows

#### Subset by Command Type

Pressing <**F17**> from the list of Event commands branches to a window display where a subset rule may be selected to limit the commands on the main list display.

 Â 

#### Functions

- **F12=Cancel**: Quits the subset window and returns to the Event Management list.
- When sub-setting is in effect, the appearance of the Event Management screen changes slightly. The figure below shows a subsetted list of just the events for Command Type Job, and the <**F17**> function key legend has changed to show its new capability.
- While in the subset mode, <**F17**> can be used to change the Command Type being used for the subset. In order to clear the subset mode and return the Even Management list to a full display, just clear the Type Number value from the input field in the subset window and press <**Enter**>. This updates the subset window and returns to the main list display.

### LSAEVTR02 - CPYTOMSGIN Events prompt

#### CPYTOMSGIN Command Prompting Window

The general-purpose Event command CPYTOMSGIN is supported by an additional prompting window (when selected from within the context of the Event Management LSAM menu function) that lists all available OpCon Event commands.

For extended information about using the CPYTOMSGIN command, please refer to [Using CPYTOMSGIN](#using-cpytomsgin).

CPYTOMSGIN Event Selection Window
```
            CPYTOMSGIN Events

In the syntax model illustrated above, the < > characters are used only to mark the description of each field. When the actual data is typed in place of the field description, the < > characters must be removed, just as the field description must also be removed. However, the commas are a critical part of the command syntax. If a field value is allowed to be left out of any particular command, the comma that marked that field location must still be retained. In this case, two consecutive commas would indicate to OpCon that the null value  should be applied to that field.

Press <**Enter**> after the command has been fully formatted to cause the final command format to be submitted to the LSAM for sending to OpCon.

:::note
When the CPYTOMSGIN prompting, as illustrated above, is accessed from within the Agent's automation tools master file maintenance functions, pressing <**Enter**> returns the formatted External Event command to the field where the cursor was located when the function key for prompting Events was pressed.
:::

Dynamic Variable tokens can be included anywhere within the CPYMSGIN keyword parameter:

```shell
CPYTOMSGIN CPYMSGIN('$JOB:CANCEL,,MySchedule,{JOBNAMEVAR}')
```
