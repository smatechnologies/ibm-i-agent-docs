# IBM i Function Keys

## Common Function Keys

The following list of common function key assignments reflects the way that SMA has typically assigned function keys in the IBM i LSAM software. A general attempt has been made to conform to the typical function key assignments found in many of the IBM i display formats. This gives a consistent look and feel within the LSAM software and between the LSAM software and applications from other vendors who have chosen to conform to the typical IBM assignments.
