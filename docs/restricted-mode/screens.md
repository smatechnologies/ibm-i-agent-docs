### Add New Script

A window is displayed for typing in a new Script name when function
<**F6**> (Add) is pressed. This occurs before the program displays the
Restricted mode options detail screen where the new Script Actions will
be defined.

The same format of the New Script Name window is displayed for both
function <**F6**> (Add) and function <**F3**> (Copy). The only
difference will be the title line of the window, where the title line
for <**F3**> (Copy) will show the name of the Script that is being
copied.

    F6=Add
- Main Menu > Restricted mode menu (\#5) > Setup options (\#1) >
    Copy Script option (\#3)

##### Fields


| Field           | Default   | Required | Description         |
| ------- | -----| ------| -------|
| New script name | \*DEFAULT | Y        | A user-defined name for each group of Action codes. It is recommended that the most commonly used Restricted Mode script be named "*DEFAULT" in order to support the default action of the STRSAVRST command.            |
|                 |           |          | **Note:** Users of a prior release of the LSAM who already had a single Restricted Mode script defined will have that script automatically converted to a script name of *DEFAULT. This will ensure that their system uses the STRSAVRST command the same way it did in the prior release (the STRSAVRST is submitted by OpCon/xps scheduling without any script name parameter).         |

##### Functions

- **F3=Exit**: Quits the Add New/Copy Script window without updating
    and returns to the menu.

- Main Menu > Restricted mode menu (\#5) > Setup options (\#1) >
    option 2=Change

##### Fields


| Field | Default  | Required | Description      |
| ---- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| Script name Action   |                  | n/a      | The name of the Script in which this Action code is being added or changed.  |
| Action           | None             | Y        | A user-defined or a system-reserved name for each sequenced step that is part of restricted mode operations.    |                 
| | | | **Note:** Action codes ENDSYS and STRSYS are reserved and required. ENDSYS must be the operation that puts the system into restricted mode, while STRSYS must be the operation that restores normal mode operations. Other steps may be placed before, between  or after these required steps. Also refer to the discussion [Optional ON_ERROR Script Action Code](#Optional)  about the special ON_ERROR Action code.*   |
| Sequence         | Next available number  | Y        | -   The order in which the steps in RDY status will be performed. Note that Actions in HLD status will be sorted to the end of the list, separate from the steps in RDY status which are listed in order of their sequence number.    |
| | | | -   The default sequence number supplied may not be the next highest number among all sequences if there are Actions in HLD status at the end of the list. Instead, the last Action in HLD status becomes the reference for the system-supplied default sequence number. The person performing this maintenance is responsible for updating the sequence number so that the list of Actions to be performed will occur in the correct order.       |
| | | | **Note:** A former restriction on the use of sequence numbers has been removed from the system  and replaced with reserved names for certain Action codes.      |     
| Status           | System defined   |          | When the options detail screen is presented in Change mode, the existing status of an Action will appear in this field. This value cannot be changed on this display; it is updated by using options 3 and 6 from the list of Actions display. |
| Description      | None             | N        | A user-supplied description of what function the Action will perform. |
| Stop Execution on Error  | None             | Y        | -   Y=Yes      |
|          |                  |          | -   N=No         |
|          |                  |          | -   This instruction flag causes theRestricted Mode operations to be suspended if an Action that is flagged as Y=Yes, encounters an error condition. In that case, the Restricted Mode operations program will go into AutoRecovr mode, restore normal system operations, and report the error.   |
| Command line     | None             | Y        | Type the IBM i command to be executed. The <**F4**> (Prompt) key supports access to IBM i command prompting. When <*Enter**> is pressed from the prompt display, the resulting command text will be inserted into this field. |

 
:::caution *Special Action circlular code: ON_ERROR
There is a special Action code name ON_ERROR that is reserved as an optional step that may be added anywhere in the sequence of Script steps. Each time ON_ERROR is specified, the Restricted Mode operations program registers the command that has been assigned to this Action code as the current operation to be performed in case any subsequent step in the Script might fail. The ON_ERROR command is executed after the Restricted Mode operations program ha performed most of the AutoRecovr steps (after normal system operations have been restored an the LSAM service programs have been restarted). The usual type of command that would be assigned to an ON_ERROR Action is an OpCon/xps Event.Refer to [Events and Utilities Menu](/events-utilities/menu.md)  and [Commands and Utilities](/commands-utilities/commands.md) for more information about the available OpCon/xps Event commands that may be specified. As with all Restricted Mode Action commands, the OpCon/xps Event commands may also be prompted using <**F4**> from the Restricted Mode Options Detail screen (below). ON_ERROR Action codes are ignored if the entire Restricted Mode Script executes normally.
:::

##### Functions

- **F3=Exit**: Quits the options details display without updating and
    returns to the menu.
- **F4=Prompt**: In the Command line field, go to IBM i command
    prompting. When <**Enter**> is pressed from the command prompt screen,
    the resulting command text will be inserted into this field.
- **F12=Cancel**: Quits the options details display without updating
    and returns to the list of Actions.

## Setup Restricted Mode Environment

In Setup Environment, define the environment for executing Restricted
Mode operations by specifying an environment library list and an option
for managing any exceptional messages that may arise.

- **Screen Title**: Restricted Mode Evnironment
- **Screen ID**: SAVRSTD21

##### Menu Pathways

Main Menu > Restricted mode menu (\#5) > Setup environment (\#2)

##### Fields


| Field              | Default      | Required | Description        |
| ------ | ----- | ----- | -----|
| Environment name   | SMADEFAULT   | Y        | Enter the name of the LSAM environment that  will control Restricted Mode operations. For most installations with a single, live LSAM environment, this environment will be the default name of SMADEFAULT. |
|                    |              |          | **Note:** Only one LSAM can be used at a time to control Restricted Mode operations, since these operations affect the state of the entire IBM i operation system.  |
| Restart delay seconds      | 180          | Y        | The number of seconds required by IBM i to fully restart the TCP/IP server programs. If this value is specified incorrectly, the Restricted Mode operations program may not be able to automatically restart LSAM communications whenever there has been a failure of a Restricted Mode  script.            |
|                    |              |          | **Note:** This value may be determined by examining the time stamps on messages in the System Operator message queue from a point just after an IPL or other system restart.           |
| Console job start wait | 030          | Y        | The number of seconds that the OpCon-started process initiation job should wait for the Console job (or submitted  batch job) to become active and  be able to respond to the control job.               |
| Console device/\*BATCH | \*BATCH      | Y        | -   \*CONS = The IBM i DSP01 device must be used by user SMASAV to run script steps.  |
|                    |              |          |-   \*USER = A user-designated display device may be used by user SMASAV to run script steps. However, be sure that this device will be managed by the IBM i controlling subsystem, if  the script will actually  put the system into restricted mode (which may not happen when testing with the NOENDSYS Action code).  |
|                    |              |          |-   \*BATCH = No display device is used. The OpCon-initiated control job will submit the batch job that will execute script teps.         |
| Control subsystem JOBQ & library | QBATCHQGPL   | N        | These values are required only when the \*BATCH mode will be used. For batch mode, this tells the OpCon-initiated control job where to submit the script execution batch job.   |
| QCONSOLE           | system value | n/a      | This display-only field shows which device has been designated as the IBM i operating system console device. This value identifies the display device that must be used for \*CONS mode.   |
| QCTLSBSD           | system value | n/a      | Two fields show the name and library location of the Subsystem Description that describes which IBM i subsystem is the controlling subsystem, used exclusively when the system is put into its restricted mode.   |
| Seq                |              |          | The sequence number that is automatically assigned to each library in the library list. This number is only for clarification of the order of the library list. |

##### Functions

- **F3=Exit**: Quits the environment details display without updating
    and returns to the menu.
- **F4=Prompt**: From the Environment field, the prompting function
    presents a new screen that lists all available environments. It is
    possible to view the library list that defines each environment.
    Select the environment and library list that has been created for
    use with Restricted Mode operations. If no environment and library
    list has been set up for Restricted Mode operations, use <**F6**>
    (Add/maint env) to perform environment maintenance now. Then repeat
    the <**F4**> (Prompt) to select the new environment for insertion into
    the Environment field.
- **F5=Refresh**: Retrieves the latest information from the LSAM
    environment master files and updates the display.
- **F6=Add/maint env**: This function key supports access to the LSAM
    Environment maintenance functions, where new environment records may
    be created and library lists may be constructed or updated. Refer to
    [LSAM Environment Management](/environment/index)
    for more information about managing LSAM environments.
- **F12=Cancel**: Quits the environment details display without
    updating and returns to the list of Actions.
- **F15=Update SMASAV**: Access to a function required to prepare the
    user profile SMASAV and a control data area QGPL/RSTENVIRON for use
    with Restricted Mode operations.
- **PageDown**: Use the Page control keys to view more libraries if
    the complete list is not displayed on the first page.

### F15=Update SMASAV

The instructions for preparing the LSAM to use Restricted Mode
operations indicate that the following screen represents a step that is
required to configure the LSAM software. The effect of using this screen
to perform the update is that the system will know which LSAM
environment should be used as a reference point to initiate Restricted
Mode operations when the special user SMASAV signs on to the IBM i
system for this purpose. This function will also update the SMASAV user
profile with correct information about where to find the required
Initial Program.

It is recommended to always perform this function before using the
Restricted Mode for the first time, or at any time after updating or
changing the LSAM environment or programs. It is also required to
complete this function by pressing <**Enter**> when this display shows
that the Restricted Mode controlling environment is either blank or is
not the same as the Current environment. However, it is not necessary to
press <**Enter**> when viewing this display from a test environment
and that environment should not be in control of Restricted Mode
operations.

As a general rule, the default LSAM environment should be the one that
is set to control Restricted Mode. Note that this environment name will
not be the same as the Restricted Mode environment itself, shown on the
previous display format (above). This is because the environment name is
only a label for the special library list which will be in effect during
Restricted Mode operations. For more information, refer to
[SMALIBMGT](/environment/commands#SMALIBMG)
. Regarding the discussion about Multiple Environment Management,
refer to [LSAM Environment Management](/environment/index) and
[Installing Multiple Environments](/reference/multiple-environments)
.
