# Log File and Database Management

:::note REVISION NOTE
This topic was previously titled "Debug Mode." It still describes how to turn debug/audit logging on and off, but the LSAM debug/audit file management has been enhanced with additional tools that help maintain disk utilization and that make it easier to extract log and/or master files to send to SMA Support.
:::

This topic is focused on the log files that the LSAM records as it performs its automation functions. It describes how to start and stop debug/audit logging, which is separate from the daily operational log files that are always used. It also explains the tools that can be used to control disk space utilization of all LSAM files, including the logs, and how to extract log and master files so they can be submitted to SMA Support for problem analysis.
