# File Arrival Jobs using CHKFILE and CHKIFSFIL

Previously, the IBM i LSAM utility commands CHKFILE and CHKIFSFIL could
only be used for a simple, one-time, instant check for the existence of
a file. One or two additional parameters were supported to provide
feedback about user authority or locked objects. These commands could
not easily be used to watch for a file arrival. The current version of
IBM i Agent software supports a long list of optional command parameters
for these commands, enabling a File Arrival job type along with
additional file qualifiers.

Since OpCon introduced the Windows (MSLSAM) job sub-type of a File
Arrival job, a new standard was established for integrating file
watching directly into OpCon schedules. This replaced many of the
functions of the older, separate File Watcher service of the OpCon
Windows Resource Monitor -- although there were certain services
provided by the File Watcher that are still being replaced as the
Windows job sub-type model evolves.

Now the OpCon (version 17.1 and newer) IBM i job master record supports
a separate job sub-type called "File Arrival" which makes it easier to
configure file watching for IBM i, instead of using the IBM i "Batch
Job" sub-type and typing in all the CHK\* command parameters. The new
Enterprise Manager (EM) panel that appears for File Arrival jobs makes
it easy to configure this type of job with many different options. The
EM panel is actually supported by the IBM i Agent using its native
CHKFILE and CHKIFSFIL commands. In addition, the Variables Tab of the
IBM i job master record supports any of the command parameter keywords,
so that the entire range of Agent command capabilities are available to
OpCon EM users.

Both of the commands also support an off-line execution mode for use
either as a pre-test of file watching concepts, or as a production
command that might be useful in some of the IBM i LSAM automation tools,
such as Multi-Step Job scripts or as part of a collection of Captured
Data Response Rules (which support Operator Replay, Message Management
and the SCANSPLF utility). The command parameter OPCONJOB(N) is used to
disable OpCon communication functions, such as reporting a job
completion status, when the commands are used in their stand-alone mode.

SMA clients who were previously using either of these commands in IBM i
Batch Jobs can continue to execute those jobs without having to change
any OpCon job parameter. Similarly, SMA clients who have not yet updated
the OpCon server to version 17.1 or newer can still gain all the
advantages of these enhanced commands by using them as the Call command
for an OpCon IBM i job sub-type of Batch Job. All of the new command
parameters include initial default values that cause the command driver
programs to behave as they did before the EM panel support enhancements
were added. However, any existing job definitions might be worth
reviewing, to see if new command capabilities would improve the
effectiveness of the old job strategies.

## Tips and Techniques for the CHKFILE and CHKIFSFIL Commands

- New Optional Command Keywords

A long list of optional command keywords, documented below, support many
new features so that this Agent can perform a File Arrival job type and
also support an ongoing File Watcher strategy.

- Support for the OpCon File Arrival Job Sub-type

Starting with OpCon version 17.1, the IBM i job master record offers a
new job sub-type called "File Arrival." (The sub-type of jobs for the
IBM i Agent is supported by a "Job type" field within the lower EM
panel that contains job master data specific to this Agent.) The File
Arrival job sub-type supports a data entry panel that makes it easier to
define File Arrival job parameters. This technique replaces the former
strategy of using the IBM i "Batch Job" sub-type and entering raw
command line text with many optional command keywords. But, behind the
scenes, the Agent is still using the same CHKFILE and CHKIFSFIL commands
as are documented here. The following information helps to decide on
appropriate settings for the File Arrival job definition.

- Extended List of Command Completion Codes

The Agent File Arrival commands support an extended range of completion
codes. These completion codes can be sent to a local Agent's Dynamic
Variable, so that they can be tested when the CHKFILE or CHKIFSFIL
commands are used from within the Agent's local automation tools, such
as the Multi-Step Job Scripting tool.

When an OpCon Schedule submits a File Arrival job, the completion code
can be sent to an OpCon Property. But just as useful, the completion
code is also sent to three other destinations:

1. It is included in the Exit Description, that is, the displayed job
    status text.
2. It is sent within a text string as LSAM Feedback (hint: match %CKF0%
    or a specific code such as %CKF0006%).
3. Detailed Job messages provide the completion code and its
    description.

The Exit Description and the LSAM Feedback can be used to define Events
triggered by the OpCon job.

- New Options to Control the Final Job Status

A combination of the Agent's File Arrival command parameters with a
drop-down list of Failure Conditions in the OpCon EM job definition
panel allows the user to decide whether the Agent will report a final
job status of Finished OK or Failed, depending on a variety of different
circumstances. These options allow the File Arrival job to adapt to the
requirements of a software application or of the user's surrounding
OpCon Schedule dependencies.

The higher level decision about Finished OK versus Failed can be further
refined by using the OpCon job's Events tab to respond to any of the
completion codes expected from the IBM i Agent.

- New $@ Agent Variable Names Support Command Keywords

As the OpCon general standards for File Arrival jobs evolve, the full
capabilities that are unique to the IBM i Agent File Arrival commands
can be engaged by setting any command keyword value from the Variables
Tab of an OpCon job. This makes it possible to engage any of this
Agent's capabilities that are not already supported by the OpCon EM job
definition panel.

:::note
The two variable prefix characters "$@" are used consistently in this documentation to refer to the user-defined prefix characters that are defined in the LSAM Events and Utilities menu (sub-menu 3) using option 7: LSAM Utility Configuration. IBM i partitions using US EBCDIC (CCSID 37) should normally continue using the default values of "$@". Partitions using other national language character sets may need to change the prefix characters because of the way they are translated between the local version of IBM i EBCDIC and the ASCII character set used by the OpCon server. See the chapter about [Utilities Screens and Windows](/events-utilities/utilities-screens) for more information about changing the prefix characters.
:::

The IBM i Agent now supports a system-reserved naming convention for
variables that can be added to the OpCon job Variables tab, where any
command keyword can be prefixed with the characters '$@' to designate
that the Variable Name is referring to a command keyword. For example,
this Agent's command keyword "JOBENDTIME" can have a value set by
adding a variable named $\@JOBENDTIME to the OpCon job's Variables
tab. The value provided for this type of variable name must exactly
match the format and type of value that is supported by either
command's JOBENDTIME() keyword.

The $@ command keyword convention is supported by this Agent for any
IBM i job. However, it should only be used for circumstances documented
in this IBM i Agent user help, otherwise unpredictable results could
occur. As a general rule, this type of command keyword will be inserted
only within the IBM i job's CMD() line, which is a parameter of the IBM
i SBMJOB command. Thus, the $@ variable names cannot be used (at this
time) to extend the parameters of the SBMJOB command itself.

The $@ command keyword variables can be used with IBM i Batch Jobs that
are executing the CHK\* commands. These Variable tab entries may support
greater flexibility in the format of value data entry, as compared to
using the raw CHKFILE or CHKIFSFIL command keywords in an IBM i Batch
Job. For example, values for time relative to midnight can be expressed
in clock time format such as 14:30, or in decimal format such as 14.5
(where both values mean 14 hours and 30 minutes after midnight/start of
day).

## Change to the CHKIFSFIL search work library: no longer uses QTEMP

As of PTF \# 181047, the sub-programs that search the IFS stream file
directories no longer use the QTEMP library to report their search
results and errors. Instead, they use a temporary work library named
'CKF' plus the IBM i Job Number where the CKFIFSFIL command executes.

The temporary work library will be retained in case the CHKIFSFIL
command reports a failure, unless a command parameter says to ignore
failures. When the command completes normally or ignores errors, then
the work library will be deleted at the end of the command processing.

To perform debugging operations when the command completes normally, set
the new command parameter KEEPWRKLIB(Y) to the value of 'Y' = yes.

## Change to the management of the CHK-command job library list

When the commands CHKFILE and CHKIFSFIL are used in an IBM i Batch Job,
not when started by the OpCon File Arrival job type, these commands can
be requested for execution from outside of the LSAM environment. To
successfully launch these commands that do require the LSAM library
list, qualify the commands with their library location (SMAPGM/CHK...)
and then observe the following rules.

There are two existing command parameters at the end of both the
CHKIFSFIL and CHKFILE command that can be used to temporarily establish
a correct LSAM library list for the command execution job:

ENV = the LSAM environment name (defaults to the current LSAM).

GPL = the name of the SMAGPL library in this LSAM environment.

When these two parameters are set to existing values, and not left set
to their default values of '\*DEFAULT', the CHK\* commands can be
executed from anywhere within the IBM i partition without

requiring that the job's initial (or current) library list be set to
the LSAM environment library list.

When the ENV and GPL values are set to represent an existing LSAM
environment, the CHK\* command driver programs will add the LSAM
environment libraries temporarily to the job's library list, so that
the command can interact as required with tables in the LSAM database.

Prior to LSAM PTF \# 181047, the File Arrival jobs or the stand-alone
CHKIFSFIL and CHKFILE commands required that the LSAM library list be
established before the commands would execute. Now the configuration of
an OpCon job is much easier to manage, and these two commands can be
easily executed from anywhere within the IBM i partition.

## Using JOBENDTIME and RECHKFREQ Parameters to Control Job Behavior

The old, original CHKFILE and CHKIFSFIL commands performed simple,
one-time checks for a file. They were designed to be used in the Pre-Run
command line of an OpCon job master.

With the implementation of the File Arrival job sub-type for IBM i jobs,
it is now possible to control the behavior of the File Arrival job so
that it executes either a one-time check or it performs a continues file
arrival watching function. When defining the continuous file watching
function, it is important to carefully control the two IBM i parameters
that enable this capability.

- **RECHKFREQ** (Re-check frequency): This parameter creates two
    effects. When it is not zero, it implies that the check for a
    matching file will be repeated, and this frequency value specifies
    (in seconds) how long the file check program will pause before
    repeating the check for file existence. When this value is left at
    zero (by default, or intentionally specifying zero), this tells the
    file check commands that the job should perform only a one-time
    check.
- **JOBENDTIME** (Job End Time): The Job End Time works together with
    the Re-check Frequency. The primary use case for the Job End Time
    parameter is when it is expected that a file might have been created
    earlier in the day (or on a previous day), but it will not be moved
    into the watched directory (or DB2 library) until after some
    previous depended-on job has completed. Currently, the OpCon Windows
    File Arrival job depends only on the file Create End Time to govern
    when the File Arrival job should stop. But if the target file is
    believed to have a Create Time in the past, and the job only wants
    to find a file that was created on or before that time, then there
    is no good way to keep the File Arrival job running until the
    expected file finally arrives. Using the Job End Time parameter
    separates the control of the absolute time when the File Arrival job
    should give up waiting and end, and it allows the File Create End
    Time to perform only its intended function of qualify whether a
    matching file name was created during the desired window of time.
    When the Job End Time is zero (the default for this parameter), then
    the Create End Time WILL govern the absolute job end time. But when
    a Job End Time is specified, then the file check commands will use
    this value as the end time boundary for the Re-check Frequency. 

:::caution 
If both the Job End Time and the Create End Time are zeros/blanks, but the Re-check Frequency is not zero, then the File Arrival job will run endlessly until a matching file is found. This can only happen if the user intentionally creates this parameter configuration -- the default parameter values for the job will not create this endless loop. Interestingly, allowing for an endless loop makes it possible to create a real all-day file watcher. For this type of job, users can choose to have an OpCon control schedule force the job to end and then start a new one, based on their own schedule, or the endless file watcher could just keep running day after day until and unless there is a system stop or system failure. In that case, it would be necessary to have a secondary OpCon service monitor restarting itself all the time to assure that the endless file watcher job is always active. 
:::

## Using the Agent Commands in File Arrival Jobs

The recommended method for configuring File Arrival jobs in OpCon
Schedules is to select the IBM i job sub-type of "File Arrival" and
then fill in the unique job definition panel. The Variables tab of the
IBM i job can also be used to set additional command parameters using
the $@ Agent variable naming convention to represent any given command
parameter keyword. The File Arrival job sub-type will cause the Agent to
format and submit the CHKFILE or CHKIFSFIL command, with any optional
$\@VARIABLE parameters, as the File Arrival job.

Before the OpCon File Arrival job definition panel was supported for IBM
i jobs, the job sub-type of Batch Job was used and the CHKFILE or
CHKIFSFIL command with parameters was typed (or pasted) into the Call
command box. That format of File Arrival Job may still be used -- it
fully supports all the same features as the new File Arrival job
definition panel. All new command parameter keywords that have been
added to the two commands support default values that are transparent to
older formats of the command lines, so existing Batch job definitions
using the native command lines will still execute correctly.

Otherwise, the command line formats of the CHKFILE and CHKIFSFIL
commands are documented here for two purposes. First, these commands can
be used in local mode (not submitted by OpCon), such as from a Step of a
Multi-Step Job Script, or from a Captured Data Response Rule, as long as
the command parameter OPCONJOB is set to a value of (N), (T), or (A),
where both of those values refer to Test mode (offline from OpCon).
Second, a clear understanding of the native command parameters may be
required to complete more complex File Arrival job definitions,
especially when using the $@ variable names for setting command
parameter keyword values from an OpCon job's Variables tab.

### Formatting the File Arrival Command Line

A good way to prepare a correctly formatted File Arrival command line is
to use an IBM i green screen command entry line and prompt either
command using function key F4. After completing the required command
parameters, press F3 to cancel the command, then, use F9 to retrieve the
cancelled command so that the complete command line can be copied and
pasted.

When logged on to a green screen workstation, it is very helpful to use
the full screen command entry mode. This is the best way to capture
longer command lines so they can be pasted into an OpCon job's Call
command box.

To enter the full screen mode for IBM i commands, type the following
command and then press Enter:
```
CALL QCMD
```
To successfully access the File Arrival commands it is necessary to
refer to at least the Agent library SMAPGM, where the commands are
stored. To execute either command, the full Agent library list is
required. However, when simply prompting the command to format the
parameter keywords, it is only necessary to use the SMAPGM library. The
following options will support prompting the commands:

- Type SMAPGM/CHKFILE or SMAPGM/CHKIFSFIL and press F4.
- Enter the Agent (LSAM) menu system and use the menu command line to
    type only the command name, then press F4. It works better to first
    CALL QCMD before attempting to prompt, format, cancel and retrieve
    the command line.
- From any IBM i command line, the Agent commands SMAGPL/SMASETLIBL or
    SMAGPL/SMAADDLIBL can be used to replace or amplify the job's
    library list with the complete set of Agent libraries. Then it is
    only necessary to type the command name before pressing F4=Prompt.

The values specified for the many different command parameters will
depend on which of the functions listed below are required. It is
possible for one job to perform many different file checking functions,
although multiple functions requested at once will interact with each
other (in ways described below).

### Configuring an OpCon IBM i Batch Job for File Arrival

Although the original Batch Job method for defining File Arrival jobs is
no longer the recommended method, it still works, and this is the only
method for defining IBM i File Arrival jobs with versions of OpCon prior
to 17.1. File Arrival jobs that are already formatted this way will
continue to work, and can be enhanced with most of the newer features.

Here is an example of a semi-complex file watching command entered into
an IBM i batch job master record in OpCon:

Example OpCon IBM i batch job

![Example OpCon IBM i Batch Job](../Resources/Images/IBM-i/Example-OpCon-IBM-i-Batch-Job.png "Example OpCon IBM i Batch Job")

The various parameter values illustrated in the image, above, are all
explained in tables below in this document. The command line could be
much simpler, since the only value that must be specified is the
PATHNAME parameter (for this CHKIFSFIL command), or the FILE parameter
for the CHKFILE command.

All new File Arrival jobs in OpCon (version 17.1 and newer) should be
configured using the newer "File Arrival" job sub-type for IBM i jobs.

## Purpose of CHKFILE versus CHKIFSFIL

The CHKFILE command is designed for use only with the DB2 database that
comes embedded with the IBM i operating system. It is designed to work
with Libraries that contain different types of objects. Only the object
type of \*FILE is supported by this command. The file attribute would
typically be either PF-DTA or PF-SRC, although LF (logical views) and
some other \*FILE objects can also be checked.

The CHKIFSFIL command can be used with any file system supported by the
IBM i operating system. Perhaps the most common use of this command
would be to watch for files arriving in the '/' (root) file system,
which, like the basic Windows disk system, can contain nested
directories and it is not case sensitive.

:::warning
Although the '/' (root) file system is not case sensitive, the CHKIFSFIL command may use some UNIX-style APIs which are case sensitive. Therefore, the PATHNAME parameter must be managed as case sensitive.
:::

The CHKIFSFIL command can be used with other of the Integrated File
Systems (IFS), including, for example, the /QOpenSys file system that
resembles UNIX disk systems and is case sensitive. The old /QDLS
document storage file system can also be checked with CHKIFSFIL,
although this poorly performing file system is no longer recommended for
use.

CHKIFSFIL can also be used with the DB2 database file system, since it
also exists within the operating system's generalized IFS file system,
but the format for addressing DB2 tables from the IFS file system
perspective must be configured like this:

'/QSYS.LIB/MYLIBRARY.LIB/MYFILE.FILE'

**-or-**

'/QSYS.LIB/MYLIBRARY.LIB/MYFILE.FILE/MYDATA.MBR'

In most cases, it is probably better to use the CHKFILE command for DB2
tables, especially since the CHKIFSFIL command will re-route any DB2
file definitions to the CHKFILE command.

### Replacing Windows File Shares with Direct Access to IBM i

Before there was an enhanced File Arrival job method for the IBM i
Agent, many OpCon users would try to use the OpCon Windows Resource
Monitor in File Watcher mode. This required a complex configuration of
IBM i disk file shares within the Windows system where the Resource
Monitor was executing, as well as difficult management of user
authorities.

Now, the enhanced IBM i File Arrival job sub-type replaces the
dependency on IBM i file shares with direct access to any IBM i file
system. This is a welcome move towards eliminating the extra work
required for system and network administrators to configure IBM i file
shares. Another benefit of eliminating the use of file shares is a
reduced work load within the IBM i system, which improves system
performance overall.

## Using CHKFILE for DB2 Tables

The File Name field of an IBM i File Arrival job sub-type in the OpCon
EM is checked by the Agent to determine whether the file exists in the
DB2 database, or whether it is located outside of DB2 in another IFS
file system, such as the root '/' file system. It is the leading
forward slash character '/' that designates an IFS file outside of
DB2. Without the leading slash, the Agent attempts to hand the File Name
string in the DB2 format of LIBRARY/FILENAME or
LIBRARY/FILENAME(MEMBER). When a DB2 format will be processed, the Agent
uses the EM job definition panel fields to compose the Agent's CHKFILE
command for execution in an IBM i batch job.

The CHKFILE command can also be used in stand-alone mode, either inside
of OpCon using the IBM I job sub-type of Batch Job, or outside of direct
control by OpCon, from some of the Agent's local automation tools such
as a Multi-Step Job Script, or as a command in a Captured Data Response
Rule. To use this command off line from OpCon, it is necessary to
specify the command parameter OPCONJOB() with a value of N=no, or T or
A, where either value indicates "test mode" for the command. In fact,
"No" or the test mode turns off any attempt to send job information
and completion codes to OpCon. The optional parameters for sending
values to OpCon Properties are also not supported in the local test
mode; but in this case, there are Dynamic Variable names that can be
specified for similar purposes.

The CHKFILE command complete command syntax is shown here with the
default values for all parameters (where applicable):
```
CHKFILE
    FILE(libname/filename)
    LOCK(*NO)
    MEMBER(*FIRST)
    FILNAMPROP(*NONE)
    NUMRECPROP(*NONE)
    FAILCDPROP(*NONE)
    FILNAMDV(*NONE)

    AUTUSER(*JOB)
    AUT(*NONE)
    OPCONJOB(O)
    FAILONERR(Y)
    ENV(*DEFAULT)

```

The command parameter summary shown next defines each parameter and
lists possible values. However, the effect of using these parameters
together can vary the outcome of the command, as discussed below.

: CHKFILE command parameter values

## Using CHKIFSFIL for IFS Stream Files

The File Name field of an IBM i File Arrival job sub-type in the OpCon
EM is checked by the Agent to determine whether the file exists in the
DB2 database, or whether it is located outside of DB2 in another IFS
file system, such as the root '/' file system. It is the leading
forward slash character '/' that designates an IFS file outside of
DB2. When a non-DB2 IFS format will be processed, the Agent uses the EM
job definition panel fields to compose the Agent's CHKIFSFIL command
for execution in an IBM i batch job.

The CHKIFSFIL command can also be used in stand-alone mode, outside of
direct control by OpCon, from some of the Agent's local automation
tools such as a Multi-Step Job Script, or as a command in a Captured
Data Response Rule. To use this command off line from OpCon, it is
necessary to specify a value of (N), (T), or (A) for the command
parameter OPCONJOB(), where (N) = not an OpCon job and either value (T)
or (A) indicates "test mode" for the command. In fact, the test mode
turns off any attempt to send job information and completion codes to
OpCon. The optional parameters for sending values to OpCon Properties
are also not supported in the local test mode; but in this case, there
are Dynamic Variable names that can be specified for similar purposes.

The CHKIFSFIL command complete command syntax is shown here with the

: CHKIFSFIL Command Parameter Values

## Interaction of Command Parameters

The CHKFILE and CHKIFSFIL commands share several of the same parameters,
so the performance of both commands are very similar. Differences
between the two commands are noted where applicable.

There are many possible combinations of parameters that may be used or
ignored, so some combinations might produce unique results that are not
anticipated by this document.

### Order of Command Parameter Response

Both commands process their parameters in the following order.

1. The commands initialize any specified OpCon Properties or LSAM
    Dynamic Variables to initial values that represent no result:

    a.  File Name is set to \*NONE.

    b.  File size or number of records is set to 0 (zero).

    c.  Failure Code (command completion code) is set to CKF0000 (the
        message ID which implies that no completion code has been
        received).

          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          ![White pencil/paper icon on gray circular background](../../../Resources/Images/note-icon(48x48).png "Note icon")   **NOTE:** [Code CKF0010 is the normal completion code for a valid file found.]
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Check if a file name exists in the specified library or directory
    path that matches the specified exact or generic file name.

3. Verify the selected file was created within the Start and End times
    (if either is not zero).

    a.  For generic file name searches, if one matching file name does
        not have a qualifying File Create time, then the list of
        matching names will be searched in alphabetic order until
        another file with a matching names does have a qualifying File
        Create time.

4. When the re-check frequency is not zero, the command will repeat its
    checks for file existence and create start/end times until a match
    is found, or until the Job End time is passed.

    a.  When the re-check frequency is left at zero, then the File
        Arrival job performs a one-time File Check (which was the
        original mode of these IBM i CHK\* commands, so it is still
        supported by leaving the re-check frequency set to its default
        value of zero).

    b.  The Job End Time is either specified in its own parameter, or if
        that value is zero, then the File Create End Time is used also
        for the Job End Time. If both time values are zero, then the Job
        End Time will be assumed to be 24 hours from the IBM i system
        job start time.

5. As soon as a qualified file is identified, the file name value is
    stored in any requested OpCon Property or LSAM Dynamic Variable.

    a.  The initial size or number of records is also set in the
        Property or Dynamic Variable. The size/number of records will be
        updated if the stable duration is being checked and a new file
        size or record count is found.

6. After a qualified file is found, the optional checks for file locks
    or file authority/permissions are performed on that file.

7. The final command status is stored in any requested OpCon Property
    or LSAM Dynamic Variable.

8. Just before the command ends, it generates data value communication
    for OpCon jobs:

    a.  The $ARRIVED FILE NAME system property is set (using the OpCon
        Field Code 64), as the very first step of closing out the job.
        Sending this value before any other data transmissions, such as
        the OpCon Properties named here, usually allows enough time for
        OpCon to store and process the $ARRIVED FILE NAME into its
        parts (as supported by OpCon version 17.1 and newer), so that
        these OpCon system properties could be utilized in the Events
        processed at the end of the same OpCon job, if desired.

    b.  The IBM i LSAM utility command LFEEDBACK is executed as
        necessary, sending a text message that includes the final
        command status code to OpCon, and possibly also a zero data
        message that includes code CKF0005. All LSAM Feedback from these
        commands is type 5802 = user-defined LSAM Feedback from the
        LFEEDBACK command. Response to LSAM Feedback is defined under
        the Events tab of an OpCon job.

          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          ![White pencil/paper icon on gray circular background](../../../Resources/Images/note-icon(48x48).png "Note icon")   **HINT:** [Use an LSAM Feedback match value for specific codes like this: %CKF0006% for example.]
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    c.  One or more Detailed Job Messages are posted to the OpCon Job
        Information (accessed under the "Configuration" tab after Job
        Information is selected from the OpCon Job context (right mouse
        click) menu, or by simply using a left mouse double click on the
        job icon).

### Rules for Command Parameter Interaction

In addition to the order of parameter processing, above, the following
rules govern how the file check commands perform, based on whether the
File Create Start and/or End Times are specified (not zero), and/or a
Job End Time is specified.

When a job ends abnormally or fails, an appropriate message ID is
reported as the command completion status to suggest the cause of the
failure. Whether an OpCon Job shows as failed for not finding a
qualified file will depend on the FAILONERR override parameter, and/or
on the FAILIFZERO parameter.

Depending on the FAILONERR parameter setting, the OpCon job can be
marked as completed normally even when there is an error, but the job
completion status (termination code) will show the actual message ID
reported by the command. The description of unique job failure codes may
appear among the OpCon Detailed Job Messages (at: Job Information -\>
Configuration -\> Detailed Job Messages). The job's response to the
actual completion code can be managed by the Events tab of the OpCon
job, using either the Exit Description or the LSAM Feedback.

Similarly, when the commands are executed outside of OpCon control, the
command execution program will either appear to fail (by using the RPG
program technique that forces a program failure condition) or it will
appear to end normally (if FAILONERR = No), even if the command final
status code indicates no file was found or a found file did not qualify.

The FAILONERR parameter supports one unique value that changes its
effect on the job. A value of "T" means that when no file is found by
the End Job Time, the job should still end normally (that is, the user
does not care if no file is found on any given day). However, any other
error would cause the job to end abnormally, since the FAILONERR
parameter value is not overriding all errors in this case. When using
the value FAILONERR(T) it becomes important to test the job completion
code, in order to determine if a normally ending job actually found a
file or whether completion code CKF0009 was sent (where CKF0009 is the
special error code that indicates no file was found as the End Job Time
expired).

The FAILIFZERO parameter typically has the opposite effect of the
FAILONERR parameter. That is, when a qualified file is found, the user
can decide if the File Arrival job should report a failure when the file
contains zero records or zero bytes.

Following are some additional details about how the File Arrival
processing may behave.

1. When the job starts, the watcher program looks for a file that
    matches the file name, or a generic file name. If a file is found
    that has a Create time stamp that falls within the Start/End times,
    then the job ends normally (unless FAILIFZERO forces it to end
    abnormally).

2. When a generic name pattern was provided, the watcher program
    searches through the list of matching names. For each matching name,
    it checks if the file Create time stamp falls within the Start/End
    times. The first matching name that was created within the Start/End
    times causes the job to end normally (and that file name is provided
    in the optional OpCon Property and/or LSAM Dynamic Variable, as well
    as being reported to the $ARRIVED FILE NAME for OpCon jobs).

3. When no matching file name was created within the Start/End times, a
    File Arrival job with a non-zero RECHKFREQ value will enter a
    monitor routine that will continue to check for a new file that is
    created within the Start/End time.

    a.  The "Re-check frequency" can be left set to zero. A zero value
        will mean that a matching file name must be found on the first
        check, and any matching file name must have a Create time stamp
        that falls within the Start/End times (assuming they are not
        zeros). If no file is found with a matching name, or no matching
        name has a valid Create time stamp, then the job will end as
        failed (unless the FAILONERR parameter forces a normal job end),
        and it will not continue to check for the file until the End
        time is reached. This zero re-check frequency option allows for
        a simple, one-time file check that still uses the Start/End
        times, but only for a one-time check with an immediate result.

4. If the job started before the specified Start time, it will not
    start watching for a new file until the current time is equal to, or
    greater than the Start time. Instead, the job will be placed into a
    time-delay status that expires as the Start time is reached within
    the processing IBM i operating system.

5. When the watcher job discovers that the current time is equal to, or
    greater than the Job End time, it stops watching for any files, and
    if no file was found, the job ends as failed. In this case, the
    failure code will be the special code of CKF0009, rather than the
    other codes of CKF0002 (file not found) or CKF0006 (no file matches
    Create Start/End times).

6. There is a special case when the file Start and End times are both
    in the past. If the re-check frequency is left set to zero, then
    only one check will be performed for the file. But if the re-check
    frequency is greater than zero, the File Arrival job will continue
    to wait for a file to arrive at the specified directory or library
    location until the Job End Time is reached (see above for rules
    about how a Job End Time is ALWAYS defined, even if it defaults to
    24 hours after the IBM i system job start time).

    The use case for this type of job would be that a file was actually
    created in a different location, but it was not moved to the watched
    location until some depending-on prior job has completed its task.
    Then the expectation is that the file will eventually be moved into
    the watched location and immediately found by the waiting File
    Arrival job.

    This use case justifies the distinction between the File Create End
    Time and the (optionally) separate, specific Job End Time. Creating
    a File Arrival job with this capability could be especially useful
    during recovery processing after a Disaster Recovery restarts
    processing after a much-delayed system time. For this type of
    special case, also consider how the CRTREFDATE and JOBREFDATE
    parameters will be set to control which date will be used as the
    Midnight reference date.

### Start and End Time Calculation versus Midnight

The File Create Start and End times define a window of time within which
the designate file must have been created, or have arrived in the target
directory.

The Start and End times may be left at zero, in which case they are
ignored. In this case, the file must exist at the moment when the CHK\*
command is executed, otherwise either command will return a CKF0002 code
= file not found.

When the Start or End times are used, the value that must be provided
for these parameters is a decimal number that refers to the hours either
before or after midnight.

"Midnight" refers to the very start of the day designated by the
midnight date. Therefore, if today's date is derived as Midnight, then
a value of (15) or (+15) will refer to 3:00 PM today. A value of (-15)
will refer to 9:00 AM yesterday. Similarly, a value of 14.5 will refer
to 2:30 today (that is, 14 hours and 30 minutes after Midnight).

:::note
For OpCon jobs, whether for the EM File Arrival job or a simple IBM i Batch Job, the Variables tab can optionally support a format of +/- hhhhh:mm, where +14:30 would mean 14 hours and 30 minutes after Midnight. It is also possible to specify decimal values (as above) in the Variables tab Values column, but this is not necessary since the times can be specified with decimal values in the Batch Job command line, or by using the easily managed user interface of the newer EM File Arrival job. For OpCon jobs when the EM File Arrival job is being used, the only way to specify the CRTREFDATE is to use the Variables tab and specify one of the valid date values in the Value column for the variable named $\@CRTREFDATE.
:::

The CRTREFDATE parameter can be used to control which date is used as
the Midnight date. Please refer to the command parameters Values tables
above for the various ways that midnight can be designated, or what it
means when this parameter is not specified and will use its \*DEFAULT
value. Specific values that are supported include \*SCHED (= the
Schedule Date for an OpCon job) and \*JOB (= the IBM i Job Date), in
addition to either an actual date specified in the format 'CCYYMMDD'
(including the single quotes). It is also possible to put an LSAM
Dynamic Variable token into this command parameter (surrounded by single
quotes).

:::note
For OpCon jobs when the EM File Arrival job is being used, the only way to specify the CRTREFDATE is to use the Variables tab and specify one of the valid date values in the Value column for the variable named $\@CRTREFDATE.]
:::

The concept of using decimal numbers to designate hours is required to
keep these IBM i commands compatible with the previously established
OpCon Windows "File Arrival" Job Action type, because this is how
OpCon sends the time values to an Agent (LSAM) for processing: as
positive or negative values where up to 5 whole numbers can be used to
specify the number of hours, and the minutes are optionally specified by
up to 2 decimal places (representing 10ths or 100ths of an hour).

Accordingly, a value of 1.25 refers to one hour and fifteen minutes.
Mathematically, the decimal portion of the number is multiplied against
a total of 60 minutes and then rounded (not truncated) to the nearest
minute.

Other rules about how the Start and End times control the file checking
commands are describe in the previous two sections of this document.

The JOBENDTIME and JOBREFDATE are processed in exactly the same manner
as the File Create Start/End Times. But for EM File Arrival jobs, these
two parameters can only be specified by providing Values under the
Variables tab for the two parameter names $\@JOBENDTIME and
$\@JOBREFDATE.

:::tip
Within the IBM i system, if a file was created during Standard Time, but then the File Arrival job executes during Daylight Saving Time, the green screen display of the Creation Date/Time will differ by one hour from the Create time supplied by the API services utilized by the File Arrival job. (The same holds true for the opposite case, that the file was created during Daylight Saving Time but the File Arrival job executes during Standard Time.) In other words, the API services compensate for the time differences, but the user view from the green screen commands can confuse the user about what would be the correct time to specify for a File Create Start/End Time value.
:::

### Using the FAILIFZERO Parameter and CKF0005 LSAM Feedback

Both the CHKIFSFIL and CHKIFSFIL commands support a parameter
FAILIFZERO, which works the same for stream files in the IFS file
systems, as does for the CHKFILE command. CHKIFSFIL reports zero bytes
of data content in stream files (outside of the DB2 database), while
CHKFILE reports zero records in DB2 tables (files).

The FAILIFZERO parameter is set just before the command job ends, if the
byte or record count is zero. A value of (\*YES) for this keyword tells
the program to force a failed status, which results in an OpCon job
being set to failed and showing a final status code of CKF0005. A value
of (\*NO) allows the command job to end normally (as long as no other
circumstances are forcing a failure), even if the byte or record count
is zeros.

Both commands will always report the message ID 'CKF0005' whenever
zero bytes or zero records are detected (as the command ends). This
reference code will be sent to both the OpCon Detailed Job Messages and
also as LSAM Feedback.

Since the CKF0005 code is sent as LSAM Feedback in all cases when zero
bytes or records are found, both commands can adapt to any automation
objective with regard to zero data. Even if it is desired that this type
of File Arrival job for IBM i should end normally, OpCon can still be
configured with an automatic response to zero data by adding an Event
for the LSAM Feedback.

LSAM Feedback response is defined under the Events tab of an OpCon job.
Click the +Add button and then select the "LSAM Feedback" radio
button. In the Trigger Details panel, click the arrow to drop down the
list of available LSAM Feedback types. Click on "User defined text from
LFEEDBACK command". In the String to Match box, type: %CKF0005% then
click Next. Complete the Event command selection and configuration, then
click Finish to store the new Event rule with the job master record.

LSAM Feedback for the CKF0005 code can be configured even if the
FAILIFZERO command parameter is set to (\*YES). However, the strategy
for which Events to trigger upon job failure must be compared to the
Event that might be selected for the LSAM Feedback. In a simple case, it
is probably not necessary to configure LSAM Feedback for CKF0005 when
the job is using FAILIFZERO(\*YES), because the failed job status of
CKF0005 can also be tested as an Event, among other possible causes of
failure (including code CKF0002 = file not found, or not found within
Start/End times).

## Command Feedback Methods

The CHKFILE and CHKIFSFIL commands share most of the IBM i message IDs
and job feedback functions.

### Job Completion Codes

The command completion status is reflected by one of the following IBM i
message IDs. Certain message IDs have a common special purpose:

- CKF0000 = The commands initialize any OpCon Property or LSAM Dynamic
    Variable with this value, which indicates no result has yet been
    reported.
- **CKF0010 = The command reports normal completion: a matching file
    name was found with a qualifying create time and there are no lock
    or authority conflicts.**
- CKF0099 = Unexpected, this type of error will always cause the
    command to be reported as failed, regardless of the FAILONERR
    override setting. When a command reports this completion code, it
    may be necessary to contact SMA Support for assistance to prevent
    this type of command failure in the future.

  Message ID    Message Text
  ------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  CKF0000       CHKFILE/CHKIFSFIL has initialized the command completion code = no result
  CKF0001       CHKFILE/CHKIFSFIL file name not found
  CKF0002       CHKFILE/CHKIFSFIL library or path not found
  CKF0003       CHKFILE detected file lock
  CKF0004       CHKFILE data file member not found
  CKF0005       CHKFILE/CHKIFSFIL found zero records or zero bytes
  CKF0006       CHKFILE/CHKIFSFIL file create time outside of parameters
  CKF0007       CHKFILE/CHKLFSLST user not authorized to library, path or file
  CKF0008       CHKFILE list object API reports object is damaged
  CKF0009       CHKFILE/CHKIFSFIL file not found by Create End Time (re: FAILONERR=T)
  **CKF0010**   **CHKFILE/CHKIFSFIL ended normally**
  CKF0099       CHKFILE/CHKIFSFIL failed due to database or program

  : CHKFILE/CHKIFSFIL command completion codes

The command completion codes are reported in four ways:

- They will be stored in an OpCon Property and/or an LSAM Dynamic
    Variable, if these are specified in the command parameters.

- The OpCon Job Completion code shows the command completion code and
    the name of the command that reported it, such as: CKF0010:CHKFILE
    or CKF0006:CHKIFSFIL.

- The commands send Detailed Job Messages to OpCon, where they can be
    viewed under the "Configuration" tab that appears after using the
    right mouse click context menu to choose Job Information. (Job
    Information can also be accessed by using a left mouse double click
    on the job icon.)

- LSAM Feedback: See the following discussion for ways to configure
    OpCon Job Events in response to varying LSAM Feedback content.

In newer versions of OpCon (such as 16.x and newer), the job completion
code can be tested and an Event command generated in response, using the
OpCon job master Event types of Exit Description or Job Completion
Complex Expression.

### IBM i Job Log Messages

Whether using a local IBM i automation tool, or an OpCon job, the IBM i
job log from the job where these commands are executed, will typically
contain the job completion codes listed above. In addition, more
information about job failures will be provided by IBM i messages and by
the following LSAM File Arrival message IDs that deliver informational
text:

  Message ID   Message Text
  ------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  CKF0996      CHKFILE/CHKIFSFIL both use this message ID to add commonly reported diagnostic information to the job log.
  CKF0997      CHKIFSFIL uses this message ID to document the type of forced program error used to make the job end abnormally (as when a file is not found). It reports which RPG Halt Indicator was used: H1 = command parameters require the job to fail; H2 = the program was aborted due to an unexpected error condition. Halt indicator H2 may require assistance from SMA Support.
  CKF0998      CHKFILE uses this message ID to document the type of forced program error used to make the job end abnormally (as when a file is not found). It reports which RPG Halt Indicator was used: H1 = command parameters require the job to fail; H2 = the program was aborted due to an unexpected error condition. Halt indicator H2 may require assistance from SMA Support.

  : CHKFILE/CHKIFSFIL informational messages

Remember to use the "View Output" function for OpCon jobs as a
convenient way to quickly access the IBM i job log report for
discovering these additional information messages.

### LSAM Feedback

The CHKFILE and CHKIFSFIL commands always send LSAM Feedback to OpCon,
when the job was started by OpCon. (LSAM Feedback cannot be processed
outside of the OpCon server, so it is not generated when the OPCONJOB
flag is set to 'N' = No.)

The LSAM Feedback generated by these commands will always be type 5802 =
"User-defined feedback from the LFEEDBACK command." (This is one of
the LSAM Feedback types that appears on the drop-down list for IBM i
jobs.) This makes it possible to define one or more Events to be
triggered, based on the varying content of the LSAM feedback message. A
different event could be trigger for each possible match to a completion
code if the LSAM Feedback search rule is set to look for %CKF0006% (or
any of the other message IDs listed above).

For more information, see also the discussion above under Interaction of
Command Parameters: Using the FAILIFZERO command parameter and CKF0005
LSAM Feedback.

### LSAM Log File

The LSAM file check commands log exceptional events into the IBM i LSAM
general purpose log file named LSALOGF30. This log file can be viewed
using the LSAM sub-menu 6, option 5, log viewer 4. This menu option
(currently) uses the IBM i command DSPPFM to display the log entries.
Entries of type DV: or CF: are logged by the check file commands.

- **DV**: entries report when any LSAM Dynamic Variable tokens were
    found and then replaced.
- **CF**: entries report unexpected program failures, such as when an
    IBM i API (application program interface) routine has returned an
    unexpected result. These CF: entries help to explain why a check
    file command has reported a failure completion code of CKF0099.

## IBM i LSAM Dynamic Variable Support

### Dynamic Variables Receiving Feedback from the Commands

As identified in the command parameters tables, above, some values
detected or determined by the check file commands can be stored into
Dynamic Variables. When these parameter values are specified, the
dynamic variable names must not be enclosed within the curly braces { }
that are used to designate a dynamic variable token. Just name the
dynamic variable that should receive the value.

Dynamic variable names specified in these store-to parameters do not
have to be defined in advance, since the LSAM command SETDYNVAR that the
commands use can create new dynamic variable table records at run time.

When storing a file size or a file record count, it is possible to let
the dynamic variable be created at run time. However, if the numeric
value stored for these counts should be processed later as a numeric
dynamic variable, then the dynamic variable table records must be
created in advance in order to specify the numeric field size and any
value edits that should be performed later when a dynamic variable token
will be replaced by the stored numeric value.

### Using Dynamic Variable Tokens to Supply Command Parameter Values

Dynamic Variable {tokens} can be used to supply the value for some of
the command parameter keywords. These tokens are equally effective
whether they are used in the Call command line of an IBM i Batch Job in
OpCon, or in a stand-alone version of either command that may be used
separately from OpCon, such as in an LSAM Multi-Step Job script or in
the LSAM Response Rule command lines.

## OpCon Property Support

### OpCon Properties Receiving Feedback from the Commands

Similar to the Property setting fields of a Windows File Arrival job
sub-type (being added to the most recent OpCon versions which may not
yet be released, depending on the date when this document is being
read), the IBM i file watcher commands can send critical information
about files back to the OpCon server for use in other jobs, either
confined to the same OpCon schedule (using schedule instance properties)
or possibly in other OpCon schedules (as when Global Properties are
specified).

Since the LSAM utility commands send property values to OpCon using
OpCon External Event commands, then it is not possible to send job
instance or schedule instance property values up to the OpCon server
using simple syntax such as JI.PROPERTY. Instead, the property must be a
fully-qualified property name, using this format:

SI.\<PropertyName\>.\<ScheduleDate\>.\<ScheduleName\>

In the example above, the \< \> brackets and their contents must all be
replaced by actual values. However, since values may not be known until
run time, some of these values can be replaced by OpCon keywords, such
as using CURRENT or LATEST for the Schedule Date.

It may also be possible to place an IBM i LSAM dynamic variable {token}
into any one of the parameter positions. To make this work, use the
Variables tab of the OpCon IBM i job master record to push the current
Schedule Name or Schedule Date into the desired LSAM dynamic variable.
This will be managed just before the job starts, so the values will
become instantly available to the actual job as it executes.

### Using OpCon Property Tokens to Supply Command Parameter Values

The EM File Arrival job master definition panel supports specifying an
OpCon Property token in specially designated boxes for some of the
command operations. Property names can easily be selected by using
CTRL+T while the cursor is in one of the Property Name boxes. Remember
to also set the check box when these Property names will be specified.

But when the LSAM commands are used in an OpCon Job Master record for a
simple IBM i Batch Job, these tokens can only be used in the Call
command line. If the Property Names are defined in advance in the OpCon
Global Properties table, then using CTRL+T makes it easy to insert
properly formatted tokens into the command parameter keyword locations.

Here are examples of an OpCon Property token being used to supply the
actual file name that will be checked:

CHKIFSFIL  PATHNAME('/dir/subdir/\[\[CurrentFileName\]\]') OPCONJOB(O)
CHKFILE    FILE(QGPL/\[\[SI.SchedFileName\]\]) OPCONJOB(O)

In the examples above, the property names shown are not predefined OpCon
system properties, but only supposed user-defined property names that
would have to be defined in the OpCon Properties master file, and then
loaded with a valid value by some prior job.
