# LSAM Commands, APIs

The IBM i LSAM supports many of its functions and actions with IBM i commands that may be used interactively or included in user programs. These commands become an application program interface (API) to OpCon and to the LSAM itself, enabling very tight integration between clients' applications and the OpCon strategy for
synchronizing all enterprise operations. In most cases, the commands can be run either interactively or in batch mode.

:::warning
Many of the LSAM Commands may require that the IBM i job's library list be set to reference either the default or any one of multiple LSAM environments. Sometimes the requirements of a command can be set by careful configuration of the library attributes associated with a user-written command. In cases where more complex programming is implemented, consider using the SMASETLIBL command that is documented below. Note that this command has a parameter that can cause it to run in silent mode, so that no unexpected messages are generated within the user-written program.
:::

Most of the IBM i LSAM commands are listed in the table below. Many of these commands are fully explained and illustrated in the referenced sections of this document. Certain stand-alone utility commands that require a careful explanation are documented below the following table.

The term API means application program interface. This term refers to points in a software application where an interface has been prepared that allows external applications to perform or control the execution of the home applications functions. Many of the LSAM software functions have been represented by IBM i commands. These commands could be
programmed into other software applications so that those other applications can be more tightly integrated with LSAM and OpCon operations. An excellent example of how that might be accomplished is explained below the Commands table, in the section about the CPYTOMSGIN command.

## IBM i LSAM Commands

### LSAM communication to OpCon
(Refer to topic below.) Most commands work only from within a job started or tracked by OpCon.

- **LFEEDBACK**: (Enhanced for use outside of OpCon jobs) Send LSAM Feedback character string to OpCon
  - Sends character string to OpCon as LSAM Feedback trigger
- **SMAJOBMSG**: Send job detail message to OpCon
  - Sends character string to OpCon adding to Detailed Job Messages in Enterprise Manager.
- **SMASTATUS**: Send job OpCon
  - Sends job status for display in Enterprise Manager UI views.
- **SMAFAILJOB**: SMA signal OpCon to Fail Job
  - This command may be used, for example, in a Multi-Step Job Script, to force an IBM i job to fail. If OpCon started the job, the Agent will then send a "Failed" signal to OpCon as the final job status, and possibly the message ID of SMA0992.

### Events
- **CPYTOMSGIN**: Copy Event to SAM-SS message input
  - Passes Event instructions to the LSAM communications program for forwarding to SAM-SS.
- **Direct Event Commands**: (…for example… JOBRLS, NTYLOG, TOKSET) Refer to the tables of Event commands under the topic of Event Management at [Event Management: XML Event Management Commands](/events-utilities/external-events.md/#xml-event-management-commands) or [Event Management: CSV Event Management Commands](/events-utilities/external-events.md/#csv-event-management-commands).
  - Each OpCon Event has been implemented by the IBM i LSAM as an IBM i command using the same name as the Event. The command processor program passes the Event instruction to the LSAM communications program for forwarding to SAM-SS.

### Debug mode, logging, log viewers
- **STRSMALOG**: Start IBM i LSAM Logging
  - Refer to Turn On Debug Logging for more information.
- **ENDSMALOG**: End IBM i LSAM Logging
  - Refer to Turn Off Debug Logging for more information.
- **DSPJOBSTS**: Display LSAM job status master file
  - A formatted viewer for examining the current status of every job that has been managed by the LSAM. (Replaces former user index object.)
- **DSPIDXTRC**: Display the user index utilization trace log file
  - A data viewer that displays and interprets trace log entries for every action used to  maintain the LSAM job status user indexes. The user indexes (viewed by SMADSPUSI) are  transitory, but this trace log file, when turned on, retains a permanent history of how the user indexes were being used.
- **JORCMNLOG**: Display JORS communications trace log
  - A data viewer that lists the entries in the JORS communications trace log file (JORLOGF00) and provides various tools for interpreting the log file contents. A detailed display is supported to format each log entry according to its LSAM transaction codes.
- **JORTXNLOG**: Display JORS communications transaction log
  - A data viewer that displays and interprets the JORS communications program transaction log file. This file is used to track transactions until they are acknowledged and turned over to LSAM transaction processing. The log file is always in use by the LSAM. The viewer also supports inspection of the Yesterday version of this log file.
- **LSACMNLOG**: Display Job Scheduler communications trace log
  - A data viewer that lists the entries in the Job Scheduler communications trace log file, CMNLOGF00, and provides various tools for interpreting the log file contents. A detailed display is supported to format each log entry according to its LSAM transaction codes.
- **LSADSPLOG**: Displ ay LSAM job log tracking
  - A data viewer that lists all the members in the LSAM job log storage file, LSAJORF00. File LSAJORF10 contains the index entries that are actually shown on the list. The utility supports an option to display the contents of each job log.
- **LSAINPLOG**: Display Job Scheduler input transaction log
  - A data viewer that displays and interprets all the formatted transactions passed from the Job Scheduler communications program to the LSAM transaction manager.
- **LSAJORCTL**: Display spool file management control file
  - A data viewer that displays the spool file control values sent from OpCon.
- **LSAJORLOG**: Display job output retrieval activity log
  - A data viewer that displays a trace of the actions taken by the LSAM spool file server program. When turned on this log file can be helpful to prove how the LSAM managed job logs and job reports (spool files), according to the OpCon Enterprise Manager job master records for IBM i jobs.
- **LSATXNLOG**: Display Job Scheduler communications transaction log
  - A data viewer that displays and interprets the Job Scheduler communications program transaction log file. This file is used to track transactions until they are acknowledged and turned over to LSAM transaction processing. The log file is always in use by the LSAM. The viewer also supports inspection of the Yesterday version of this log file.
- **SMADSPUSP**: Display SMA User Space
  - A support utility command to view the content of the LSACONU01 user space where the User Name and Password for OpCon external event commands is stored. This encrypted content may be viewed only with security officer authority.
- **SMASUP**: Extract debug log files to IBM i save file for delivery to SMA Technologies Support.
  - This command performs the same function as F15=Extract log files. Refer to Viewing the LSAM Log Files. Also refer to SMARGZ, below.
- **DSPSUPDTA**: Display Agent Support Data
  - This command displays the profile of the Agent that is shared with the OpCon server and included in SMASUP log file extracts. The SMASUP command must be run once before the data is available to display, and SMASUP is used to refresh the data to current levels.

### LSAM Operations
- **LSAMENU**: Enter LSAM menu system
  - Direct entry to the IBM i LSAM menus, bypassing the splash display and hiddenenvironment configuration steps.
- **STRSMA**: Logs on to the IBM i LSAM menus. 
  - Logs on to the IBM i LSAM menus. Required for first entry to menus.
- **LSAMENU**: Enter LSAM menu system
  - Direct entry to the IBM i LSAM menus, bypassing the splash display and hidden environment configuration steps.
- **STRCAPJOB**: Start Capture Job mode
  - Registers a workstation or a batch job name so that any SBMJOB command is intercepted, not run, but all job details are captured and stored in the LSAM database. The Job Tracking facility must be started for this to work. The LSAM menu function that supports this command provides a view of currently registered job names.
- **ENDCAPJOB**: End Capture Job mode
  - Un-registers a workstation or a batch job so that the SBMJOB is no longer intercepted to capture jobs.
- **STRSMA**: "Start SMA" = Enter LSAM menu system
  - Logs on to the IBM i LSAM menus.
- **WRKCAPJOB**: Work with Captured jobs
  - Requires the LSAM library list. Shows a list of all captured job IDs and supports changes to job definitions.
- **WRKSMASVR**: Work with SMA (LSAM) Server Jobs
  - This command may be used from outside of the LSAM menu system. It displays a list of LSAM server jobs and supports starting and stopping individual jobs from the display. The job "Groups" in the list display match the PTF server job categories for stopping/restarting jobs.
- **WRKTRKJOB**: Work with tracked jobs
  - This command may be used from outside of the LSAM menu system. It automatically detects the LSAM environment that is in control of Job Tracking. The display produced by this command is the same as from LSAM Menu 1, function 2. Refer to Job Tracking and Queuing.

### Multiple Environment Management
- **LSAINIT**: Initialize LSAM environment. (Replaces LSASETENV command used in LSAM versions 3.xx.)
  - This command is used to configure the IBM i objects, like the LSAM subsystem description, that must be changed as an alternate LSAM environment is made ready for operations.
  - It can also be used to repair the configuration of an upgraded LSAM environment, in case version upgrade programs should create a problem with the LSAM subsystem description.
  -  Also refer to the topic of Managing Multiple Environments in Installing Multiple EnvironmentsInstalling Multiple Environments.
- **SMASETUP**: Install the LSAM software and create an environment.
  - Refer to the IBM i LSAM installation instructions. Also refer to the topic of Managing Multiple Environments in Installing Multiple Environments and LSAM Environment Management. This command is not available and is not used outside of an installation from media.
- **SMASETLIBL**: Set SMA Library List
  - Replaces the interactive job's library list.
- **SMAADDLIBL**: Add LSAM library list to existing job library list.
  - Adds the library names from the specified LSAM environment to the library list of the current job. The position of the new libraries in the list may be controlled by the command's POSITION keyword.
- **SMARMVLIBL**: Remove LSAM library list from existing job library list.
  - Removes the library names of the specified LSAM environment from the current job's library list.
- **SMALIBMGT**: SMA Library Management
  - Establishes new environments and creates library lists that are used by each environment.
- **SMALIBINQ**: SMA Library Inquiry
  - Queries LSAM environments and their library lists, but does not permit any changes.
  - This command also represents the environment selection function that can be used as a first step for either the STRSMA or SMASETLIBL command.

### OpCon Schedule Support
- **CHKDTAARA**: Check Data Area
  - May be used by OpCon as a prerun check that a data area must exist before a job is started.
- **CHKIFSFIL**: Check for the file in the IFS (non-DB2) file systems
  - A simple form of this command could be used as a pre-run job for an IBM i job master record in OpCon. However, the preferred use is in the Call command line, utilizing additional command parameters to define a File Arrival or File Watcher job. This command now supports the Enterprise Manager "File Arrival" job sub-type for IBM i jobs, when the file name begins with a forward slash '/' denoting an IFS disk location outside of DB2.
- **CHKFILE**: Check for file in the DB2 database
  - A simple form of this command could be used as a pre-run job for an IBM i job master record in OpCon. However, the preferred use is in the Call command line, utilizing additional command parameters to define a File Arrival or File Watcher job. This command now supports the Enterprise Manager "File Arrival" job sub-type for IBM i jobs, when the file name begins with a DB2 Library name (which must begin with an alpha character, and the forward slash '/' is not used, denoting a disk location inside of DB2).
:::tip 
The IBM i command CHKOBJ may also be used, especially for objecttypes other than files.
:::
- **SBMDBFCMD**: Submit command from database file 
  - May be used by OpCon as the Call command in order to tell the IBM i LSAM that the actual, very long call command string may be obtained from a database file in the DB2/400 database.  
- **RUNCAPJOB**: Run Captured Job
  - Submit the job defined by the named Captured Job ID. Refer to the topic on Job Tracking and Queuing for more information about captured jobs.
- **STROPRRPY**: Start Operator Replay
  - The command to use with an OpCon job description, specifying the Operator Replay Script by name as the parameter for this command.

### LSAM Utility
- **CHKIBMLSAM ENV(environment) STATUS (*ACTIVE/*INACTIVE)**: Check IBM i LSAM server job status
  - This command is designed to be used primarily from an OpCon job to report the current status of the LSAM server jobs. It will force a program failure when the server jobs do not match the STATUS keyword value.
- **CMDEXE, CMDEXE2**: SMA wrapper to manage IBM i command errors
  - These commands are used to execute IBM i native commands inside a "wrapper" CL program that intercepts any command failure message and makes it possible for the Agent and/or OpCon to control the OpCon job status and to respond appropriately to different error messages.
- **DSPDTAQ**: Display Data Queue
  - A data queue viewer not supplied by IBM with IBM i. Used by support technicians to verify LSAM system conditions.
- **DSPDYNVAR**: Display Dynamic Variable
  - Returns a completion message that shows the current value of the Dynamic Variable, or reports an error if not found.
- **LOGDYNVAR**: Log Dynamic Variable History
  - Use this command to store Dynamic Variable values, and/or other userdefined values, into a history log where values are marked with a time stamp and identified by multiple category codes and a description. Later, queries can be used to study trends of the values over time.
- **DSPOBJWU**: Display object where used
  - This command requires that the LSAM environment library list be in effect. It can be executed from within the LSAM menu system, or from command entry after the command SMASETLIBL has been used to set the interactive job's library list. Refer to LSAM Security and Object Authority for instructions how to use this command.
- **LSAMCMD**: Execute LSAM software commands from outside the LSAM environment
  - Refer to the discussion below explaining how to use this command.
- **REFFLOW**: Program reference flow chart
  - This command requires that the LSAM environment library list be in effect. It can be executed from within the LSAM menu system, or from command entry after the command SMASETLIBL has been used to set the interactive job's library list. Refer to LSAM Security and Object Authority for instructions how to use this command.
- **SETHEXDV**: Set hexadecimal value in a Dynamic Variable
  - This command makes it possible to store a non-display value into a Dynamic Variable, so that special values such as Carriage Return and Line Feed formatting characters can be represented by a {token} within text parameters of OpCon External Event commands, such as $NOTIFY:EMAIL.
- **SMAMMPSTS**: SMA Update Message Management Parameter Record Status
  - This command may be used, for example in a Captured Data Response Rule, to change the Status of a Parameter master record, either to Active or to Inactive.
  - This technique is often used when a Message Management Parameter cannot distinguish between a first and second instance of a message that appears twice, so that the first instance of the message is handled by the Parameter record, but then the Parameter record is set inactive before Message Management attempts to process the second instance of an apparently identical message.
  - Use of this utility command requires an understanding of the software application that issues the messages.
  - Remember to include Response Rule logic (or other OpCon/Agent automation logic) that will reset the Parameter record back to an Active state, after it is safe to do so.
- **STAT**: Show file status
  - A convenience utility that shows many attributes, including the character set (CCSID) of files in either the UDB DB2 database or the IFS (integrated file system). The syntax of the file path specified indicates which data storage type will be searched. LIBRARY/FILE is the format for UDB DB2 files.
- **UNINSTQGPL**: Uninstall SMA utilities from QGPL
  - Used to remove all IBM i LSAM program and file objects from the QGPL library if the LSAM software will be uninstalled. Utilities in QGPL are used for LSAM environment management.
- **WAITDYNVAR**: Wait for Dynamic Variable values (1 or 2) (Refer to instructions and example application in the Dynamic Variables section of this Agent User Help.)
  - Used by Captured Data Response Rules to pause or synchronize commands with Message Management, or other processes.
