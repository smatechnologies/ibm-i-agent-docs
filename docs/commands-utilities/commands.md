# LSAM Commands, APIs

The IBM i LSAM supports many of its functions and actions with IBM i commands that may be used interactively or included in user
programs. These commands become an application program interface (API)
to OpCon/xps and to the LSAM itself, enabling very tight integration
between clients' applications and the OpCon/xps strategy for
synchronizing all enterprise operations. In most cases, the commands can
be run either interactively or in batch mode.

:::warning
Many of the LSAM Commands may require that the IBM i job's library list be set to reference either the default or any one of multiple LSAM environments. Sometimes the requirements of a command can be set by careful configuration of the library attributes associated with a user-written command. In cases where more complex programming is implemented, consider using the SMASETLIBL command that is documented below. Note that this command has a parameter that can cause it to run in silent mode, so that no unexpected messages are generated within the user-written program.
:::

Most of the IBM i LSAM commands are listed in the table below. Many of
these commands are fully explained and illustrated in the referenced
sections of this document. Certain stand-alone utility commands that
require a careful explanation are documented below the following table.

The term API means application program interface. This term refers to
points in a software application where an interface has been prepared
that allows external applications to perform or control the execution of
the home applications functions. Many of the LSAM software functions
have been represented by IBM i commands. These commands could be
programmed into other software applications so that those other
applications can be more tightly integrated with LSAM and OpCon
operations. An excellent example of how that might be accomplished is
explained below the Commands table, in the section about the CPYTOMSGIN
command.
