# Message Management Overview

The Message Management feature, when enabled, allows the IBM i LSAM to respond to messages issued by jobs. The predefined IBM i LSAM responses can deliver answers to messages requiring a response as well as send events to SAM when a message appears. This same Message Management server function of the LSAM supports the job-specific message responses that may be defined for building IBM i job master records in the Enterprise Manager.

:::tip
The LSAM Message Management function must be started in order for the job-specific message management defined in the OpCon/xps job master to take effect.
