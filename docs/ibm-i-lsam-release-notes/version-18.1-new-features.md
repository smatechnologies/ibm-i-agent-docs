# Version 18.1 New Features

## 2018 December
All IBM i LSAM software fixes are listed under Version 04.00.03, and these are all included in LSAM version 18.1. This list shows the enhancements that were added to the OpCon
Agent for IBM i as LSAM version 18.1 was released, available only after upgrading to version 18.1.

| Enhancements     | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Enhancement      | (# IBMI-41) The IBM i LSAM communication with the OpCon server and with other Agents can now be optionally encrypted with TLS Security.|
| Enhancement      | (# IBMI-44, IBMI-316) The IBM i LSAM Operator Replay green screen workstation robotic automation feature now supports (1) user-defined selection of virtual display devices according to four different algorithms, and (2) more flexibility for designating the Operator Replay Script job User Profile, including relying on the OpCon Job Master User Name, just as for standard IBM i Batch Jobs. |
| Enhancement      | The IBM i LSAM communication with the OpCon server can now optionally filter connection requests according to a user-defined list of one to four allowed IP Addresses. In addition, any attempt by more than one OpCon server to connect to the same LSAM will be rejected, while the incident will be reported to both the original OpCon SAM Log as well as to the IBM i partition’s QSYSOPR message queue. When second connect attempts are rejected, the original OpCon server connection will be preserved active. |
| Enhancement      | (# IBMI-292, IBMI-318) The IBM i LSAM reporting of Detail Job Messages to each OpCon job’s Information panels is further enhanced with more messages and more helpful information for diagnosing job failures without having to investigate the IBM i LSAM logs in every case. The LSAM command SMAJOBMSG is made more flexible with a JOB( ) parameter, so that it can be used by features such as Message Management. |
| Enhancement      | (# IBMI-330) The IBM i LSAM simple FTP Job subtype among the OpCon job masters now supports extensions to the Remote System Address field, allowing the parameters of the IBM i “FTP” command to be specified. This supports identifying non-standard FTP Port Numbers at the remote site, and it may also possibly be used to engage secured FTP connections (given that the user is responsible for all system requirements of secured connections, such as digital certificate management and any other IBM i configuration options).  |
| Enhancement      | (# IBMI-355) The IBM i LSAM implementation of SMA File Transfer now supports an LSAM Network Address Translation table that enables using SMA File Transfer within a virtual IBM i partition (such as when a Client LPAR is served by the physical IP connections of a Host LPAR, and address-forwarding services are configured between the Host and its Client LPARs).
| Enhancement      | (# IBMI-363) The IBM i LSAM Message Management Parameters definition now better supports long Event (or IBM i) command lines. |
| Enhancement      | (# IBMI-366) The IBM i LSAM Dynamic Variables get another new Function Code called *HEX, used, for example, when inserting text formatting characters into OpCon Event commands such as email message texts. The Agent User Help is also greatly improved by the addition of a whole new chapter dedicated to all the features of the Dynamic Variables. Parts of this tool were removed from everywhere else in the documentation and consolidated into one, easy to locate reference. |
| Enhancement      | (# IBMI-394) The IBM i LSAM PTF (software patching) tools are enhanced with (1) a new “PTF Level” that independently identifies the authoritative software level of the Agent, avoiding confusion among “PTF Names” that appear out of sequence because of their required “application Sequence Number”; and (2) a new “DB Level” (database level) that greatly relaxes the constraints between two different LSAM environments when the LSAM Data Export/Import tool is used to exchange automation tool configurations and scripts.
| Enhancement      | (# IBMI-397, IBMI-446) The IBM i LSAM communication programs have finally eliminated any possibility of the occasional “address already in use” error.
| Enhancement      | (# IBMI-413) The IBM i LSAM Message Management feature now supports a user-selected option for governing the order in which Parameter records are executed. This improves the flexibility of using multiple Parameter records (each with a different Sequence Number) to implement more elaborate message response routines.
| Enhancement      | (# IBMI-415, IBMI-459) The IBM i LSAM SCANSPLF utility, as well as the Dynamic Variables, are now enhanced with new capabilities for preserving and counting either leading or trailing spaces. The previous default method of always trimming spaces from a character string can still be used, but new options allow for keeping either or both of any leading spaces or any trailing spaces. This prevents, for example, false matches when a short comparison string is found within a much longer string, just because the short string surrounding spaces were not being taken into consideration.
