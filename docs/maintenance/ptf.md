# LSAM Software Maintenance (PTFs)

This topic explains how to use the LSAM menu-driven tools that should be used to update the IBM i LSAM software product whenever SMA issues program corrections or enhancements in between distributed versions of the product.

Since LSAM version 18.1, it is important to note the two key fields of information that represent the software patch level of this Agent software:

- PTF Level: This is the value that is used at the highest level to represent the actual patch level of the LSAM software. Although the "PTF Name" (also known as the "PTF Number" field, such as PTF181006) is still a unique key that may be used to refer to a patch, SMA will request the "PTF Level" value from a client to determine that client's patch level for this Agent software.
- DB Level: The database level of the LSAM software indicates a cut-off point among the PTF Levels where database changes were made using the LSAM software patching tools. These enhancements to the Agent are small enough that a simple patch can install them, rather than requiring a full LSAM Upgrade to a new Version. The DB Level is the control level that is used to match LSAM environments when the LSAM Data Export/Import tool is being used. It is no longer required that two LSAM environments must match exactly at the PTF Level (although that is always recommended, to assure expected results). Only the database level MUST match. A change in the DB Level also marks a point among all the PTFs where a Rollback operation is usually not permitted. That is, the PTF Rollback capability will usually prevent rolling the software patches backwards past a DB Level boundary, although this may sometimes be permitted. But a single PTF rollback will not move the DB Level backward.

## LSAM Program Temporary Fixes

The programs that comprise the LSAM software may sometimes be updated by SMA to correct software problems or to enhance an LSAM function. SMA has used the IBM term to designate periodic changes to its software: PTF (program temporary fixes). SMA may offer PTFs that can be applied to the LSAM software, either in response to a problem report or in a proactive manner by announcing to all clients that one or more PTFs are available. If a general announcement is made, it will include instructions about how to obtain the PTFs.

Beginning with IBM i LSAM version 04.00.03, the PTF information and resources are made available, by contractual relationship with SMA, via automatic functions that can be managed from within the LSAM menu system. This topic explains how to use those menu-based tools.

### LSAM PTF Strategy

Each PTF is accompanied by its own instruction documentation that may be available in text format, stored in the LSAM database, and/or as a stand-alone Adobe Acrobat Readerâ„¢ file (type .PDF). The PTF instructions identify the changes being made to the software, including any required special instructions that may vary from the standard procedures identified in this topic. The instruction documentation may also include a reference to LSAM documentation updates, along with instructions about how to obtain the updates. Sometimes a PTF requires that the LSAM software be temporarily stopped and restarted, but some PTFs may be applied while the LSAM remains active. The standard PTF application tools on the LSAM menu will automatically handle the LSAM server job stops and restarts, based on the profile record that controls each PTF. The installation instructions may also include post-install instructions that must be completed manually after applying a PTF, in which case the list of PTFs will show a special indicator to call attention to this requirement.

The strategy for updating the IBM i LSAM software includes a method for updating program objects, and sometimes also a method for updating database files. As a rule, PTFs will not be used for database updates. Instead, database updates are better handled as part of an LSAM software version upgrade. If there are database file changes, they will be made in place in the SMADTA library (or the equivalent library in an alternate LSAM environment). Program changes are made to the LSAM base programs library, SMAPGM (or its equivalent). During the PTF application process a save file of replaced objects is automatically created in order to support the PTF rollback option. Some PTFs may not be eligible for rollback, in which case the PTF control record will show this special status and prevent the use of the rollback function.

:::tip
For versions of the IBM i (IBM i) LSAM prior to version 04.00.03, the library SMAPTF was used to install the replacement program objects delivered by PTFs. The new standard for LSAM software maintenance now only stores one copy of each program object, either in the SMAPGM library or in the SMAGPL utilities library (and/or the IBM i QGPL library, if that option was selected foo LSAM environment management tools). The PTF rollback feature makes it safe to replace the base version of the LSAM software. Now the SMAPTF library is used only to store the PTF rollback save files.
:::

The control list for LSAM PTF application is maintained in LSAM database files. The PTF level and individual PTF status of the LSAM environment may be viewed from LSAM menu 9, option 1: Work with LSAM PTFs. The PTF request, load, application and rollback functions can be controlled from any of three locations:

- List options or function keys from within the Work with LSAM PTFs function.
- Individual options on LSAM menu 9.
- Using LSAM commands from any command entry line or batch job where the LSAM environment library list has been established.

#### Auditing LSAM PTF Application

If it becomes necessary to audit the IBM i LSAM PTFs that are applied to the system, in case of suspected corruption of the LSAM PTF control database, each PTF is still represented by an application control data area in the LSAM database. Use the following command to view a list of the PTF control data areas in the SMADTA library (or its equivalent in an alternate LSAM environment):
```
WRKOBJ OBJ(SMADTA/PTF*) OBJTYPE(*DTAARA)
```

Some PTF data areas will only be found in the SMAGPL library:
```
WRKOBJ OBJ(SMAGPL/PTF*) OBJTYPE(*DTAARA)
```
The LSAM PTF routines may create additional PTF control data areas in the LSAM central utilities library, SMAGPL. These are used to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort when there might be more than one LSAM environment on a single system. They can also be used to help protect the LSAM environment management data that resides in library SMAGPL.

From time to time, usually as major LSAM release upgrades are applied, the PTF control data areas will be purged from the SMADTA and SMAGPL libraries. But not all PTF control data areas that remain in the SMADTA library necessarily apply to the current version of the LSAM. There could be PTF data areas from prior releases. If this information is important, SMA Support will explain the details during any problem
determination.

### How to Obtain and Apply PTFs

Based on many years of experience, SMA Technologies and its clients have adopted an effective and simple "fast path" procedure for obtaining and installing the IBM i Agent (LSAM) PTFs.

Clients of SMA Technologies are strongly recommended to refer to the latest available information about the LSAM PTFs, which is available for download in one or more PDF documents, stored alongside of the LSAM PTF save files in the SMA Technologies secure ftp server. New clients may contact SMA Support for instructions and to obtain a user ID and password for accessing the SMA Technologies secure ftp server.

#### How to Obtain the LSAM PTF Save Files

As of the date of this publication, the starting directory in the SMA Technologies secure ftp server for this Agent's software patches and enhancements is called "/IBMiLSAMptf". Please carefully note the sub-directories under this root location. It is important to select the sub-directory that matches the Version of the IBM i LSAM in use at the client site.

Right under the Version sub-directory, there is a "Readme" document that lists all the available software fixes and enhancements for that LSAM Version. This document may include important, sometimes CRITICAL instructions that must be followed to effectively install the latest PTFs.

There is also a PDF document that outlines the exact steps to perform for this "fast path" PTF installation method. Please examine that PDF document and do not rely solely on this documentation here, since that PDF document may contain more recently published instructions. Those instructions are more helpful than the following summary, which is presented only for orientation purposes.

SMA Technologies reminds its clients that this entire process, including obtaining and applying PTFs, can be automated using OpCon. This may be especially important for clients who are operating many IBM i partitions. Please contact SMA Support, the client's SMA Technologies Consultant, or the client's SMA Sales representative to request assistance with configuring a fully-automated LSAM PTF distribution and installation process.

#### How to Apply IBM i LSAM PTFs

SMA Technologies reminds its clients that the "PTFs" for the IBM i Agent of OpCon are not the same as the "PTFs" issued by IBM for the IBM i operating system. Except by coincidence, there is no direct relationship between the IBM i operating system PTFs and the OpCon Agent (LSAM) PTFs. If an IBM i OS PTF might be critical for correct operation of the LSAM, the LSAM PTF Readme document will explain this requirement.

For orientation purposes, here is a summary of the "fast path" steps to apply the LSAM PTFs.

1. Use the LSAM sub-menu 9, option 7, to confirm or update the LSAM PTF Configuration. (Refer to the Screens and Windows segment of this documentation section for details about the LSAM PTF Configuration values.)

2. Download the two LSAM PTF save files from the SMA Technologies secure ftp server.

    a)  The base file names are LSCTLDTA (PTF control data) and LSCUMPTF (a collection of all the available PTF save files for each numbered PTF). 

    b)  When an LSAM version matures, the LSCUMPTF save file will be divided into management segments, called "partial PTF save files." There is a separate sub-sub-directory at the SMA Technologies] secure ftp server for these partial PTF save file, along with a PDF document of instructions that explains how to use these smaller collections.

3. Choose option 2 from the LSAM sub-menu 9 to start the PTF installation process.

    a.  Option 2 from sub-menu 9 is the all-in-one PTF install option. There is usually no need to utilize any other LSAM PTF sub-menu option (except for option 7 that was completed in step 1, above).

    b.  The PTF Configuration options may be overridden using the first prompt screen that appears after option 2 is selected.

4. If any errors occur during the execution of the LSAM PTF Install process, SMA Technologies strongly recommends that clients immediately contact SMA Support for assistance, rather than trying to guess about how to recover from the error.

    a.  An incorrect response to a failure of the PTF Install process can create a big mess that is difficult to repair.

    b.  SMA Technologies will not charge off-hours Support fees in case support is required for the failure of the LSAM PTF install process.

5. Once the sub-menu option 2 is completed, SMA Technologies recommends using LSAM sub-menu option 1 to review the updated LSAM PTF list.

    a.  Note the current, new PTF level and (if available) the LSAM Database level (which is critical for the LSAM data export/import tools).

    b.  It may be important to carefully examine the last few PTF records in the list, to make sure that all PTFs show an Applied status. If there appear to be any exceptions, please contact SMA Support for advice.

### Complete Details about Obtaining and Applying PTFs

The control list for LSAM PTF application is maintained in LSAM database files. The PTF level and individual PTF status of the LSAM environment may be viewed from **LSAM menu 9, option 1: Work with LSAM PTFs**. The PTF request, load, application and rollback functions can be controlled from any of three locations:

- List options or function keys from within the Work with LSAM PTFs function.
- Individual options on LSAM menu 9.
- Using LSAM commands from any command entry line or batch job where the LSAM environment library list has been established, including in OpCon-scheduled jobs for IBM i.
**>
The instructions below for obtaining and applying PTFs refer to the individual menu options on LSAM menu 9. The corresponding options and function keys that may be used to perform the same operations from within the Work with LSAM PTFs function are clearly labeled. The stand-alone commands that represent each menu option are show in the menu option description line.

There is a single LSAM command (and menu function), SMAPTFINS, that can be used to execute the entire PTF acquisition and application process from a single request. This option becomes available as soon as the PTF options and configuration have been completed from LSAM menu 9, option 7. SMA recommends using this command (and/or menu option 2 on the LSAM sub-menu 9) as the best way to install, load and apply PTFs all in one step. This comprehensive command includes each of the individual procedures outlined below, so its command parameters may be understood by studying the individual steps of PTF application that follow.

:::tip
When using the SMAPTFINS command, only user profile QSECOFR may perform this function because the PTF application steps may periodically require QSECOFR authority. In some cases, it might be acceptable for an LSAM Administrator with *ALLOBJ authority to apply PTFs.
:::

#### Configure LSAM PTF options

1. To use the automatic on-line PTF request feature (FTP mode), obtain from SMA the following information:
    - An SMA ftp server user profile name and password
    - The IP address or URL currently used by SMA for its client ftp server
    - The path name provided by SMA at its ftp server for IBM i LSAM PTFs, e.g,. \\IBMiLSAMptf
2. Log on to an IBM i interactive workstation session as either QSECOFR or an LSAM Administrator with privileges to update LSAM PTF control
    file data.
3. From a command line, enter **SMAGPL/STRSMA**. For more information on **STRSMA** command parameters, refer to the [STRSMA Command](../operations/lsam.md#the-strsma-command).
4. Enter **9** to choose the **PTF and Security menu** in the LSAM Main Menu.
5. Enter **7** to choose **PTF options configuration** in the PTF and Security Menu.
6. <**Tab**> to the following fields and type data for each

    a.  In the **PTF source** field, type "FTP" to select the automatic PTF service provided by SMA. (This FTP option is only useful at sites where firewall rules allow the IBM i partition to access an outside connection to the internet. Or, it may be used when sites will import the PTF save files to a Windows or UNIX ftp server within the firewall of the site LAN.) Other options for this field are discussed in the next section of this document; [the IFS method is recommended for clients].     
        
    b.  In the **SMA ftp user** field, type the user profile name provided by SMA (or an alternate source) for its ftp server.

    c.  In the **Password** and the **Confirm Pwrd** fields, type the FTP server user profile's password that was provided by SMA (or an alternate ftp server provider).

    d.  In the **FTP URL or IP address** field, type the URL path or the IP address provided for communication with the ftp server.

    e.  In the **Source directory or path** field, type the path name provided by the ftp server source administrator for the location of IBM i LSAM PTF resources. (This field may also be used for a directory name when sources other than FTP have been selected.) The path name (Windows, Unix or IBM i IFS root directory format) must end with a forward slash (/), and most root directory servers also require that the path name begin with a forward slash (/).

    f.  Select one of the available options for the **PTF - LSAM server stop opt**. (Refer to the table of fields for the PTF configuration screen in the Screens and Windows section, below, for more information.)

    g.  Select one of the available options for the **PTF - Restart servers opt**.

    h.  Select 'Y' = yes or 'N' = no for the **PTF process default values** options: **Submit job?** and **Auto-load after request?**

       i.  Specifying 'Y' = yes for the Submit job option is usually best for system performance. Use 'N' = no for interactive processing only to perform process problem diagnostics.

       ii. The option for Auto-load after request should normally be set to 'Y' = yes. The PTF data requested from the ftp server is not useful until it has been loaded into the LSAM database. The only reason for handling this separately is if the requested information will be redistributed to an intermediate staging site after it is downloaded. This might be necessary in a high security environment in order to move the PTF resources past a secured firewall.

    i.  When the Submit job? option is set to 'Y' = yes, also supply values to define the submitted job attributes:

      -  **Job description** and **Job description library** use SMALSAJ00 in SMADTA.

      - **Job queue** and **Job queue libr** (library); the job queue should be set to a queue and subsystem that will
            continue to operate even if the PTF application process needs to stop the LSAM subsystem, such as QBATCH.

7. Press <**Enter**> to update the PTF configuration options.

#### Request a List of Available PTFs

1. Log on to an IBM i interactive workstation session as either QSECOFR or an LSAM Administrator with privileges to update LSAM PTF control file data.
2. In the command line, enter **SMAGPL/STRSMA**. For more information on **STRSMA** command parameters, refer to the [STRSMA Command](../operations/lsam.md#the-strsma-command).
3. Enter **9** to choose the **PTF and Security menu** in the LSAM Main Menu.
4. Enter **3** to choose **Request PTF information or save files**. The command SMAPTFREQ will be prompted in the PTF and Security Menu.
5. On the SMAPTFREQ command prompt screen, <**Tab**> to the following fields and enter the following data:

    a.  In the **PTF request type** field, type ALLOBJ to request all list information and the cumulative collection of PTF save files. (Refer to the Screens and Windows section below for more information about other options).

    b.  For the ALLOBJ option, skip the **ONEPTF PTF name** field.

    c.  Usually it is appropriate to leave the field **LSAM environment name** set to *CURRENT when the LSAM menu has been used to start the request function.

    d.  Leave the field **LSAM SMAGPL Utility Library** set to the value  of *DEFAULT. (Other values are supplied for SMA internal development tasks, or other special applications of this tool.)

    e.  The field **Submit job** would usually be left at the default value of asterisk (*), meaning to use the PTF control file options (that were set in the previous procedure, above). The PTF process would typically complete faster and with less impact on system performance when performed as a batch job, rather than executed interactively.

    f.  Leave the **Automatic load after request** option set to asterisk (*) to use the PTF control file option. Typically this should be set to 'Y' = yes because the requested data is not useful from the LSAM menu system until it has been loaded.

    g.  The **PTF source access method** is left at the default value of asterisk (*) which refers to the PTF control file option, set above to 'FTP'. (Other request options are explained in the next section of this document.)

    h.  Both the **FTP IP Address** and the **path name** should have been set in the PTF options configuration, above.

    i.  Ignore the field **Override SAVF name of OPT**, since the access
        method will be FTP.
6. Press <**Enter**> to complete the command prompting phase of the request process.
7. The **PTF Request Parameters** confirmation screen appears. This screen is used to confirm that the correct options were selected from the PTF configuration file, whenever the SMAPTFREQ command has been used in an interactive job. (If this command is executed in a batch job, the confirmation screen is skipped and the existing PTF configuration values are assumed correct.) Type any changes if necessary, then press <**Enter**> to complete the process of submitting the PTF request procedure to a batch job. An LSAM normal completion message appears at the bottom of the LSAM menu display.
9. Monitor for completion of the job SMAPTFREQ. One command that may be used to work with the submitted job (if authorized) is: **WRKSBMJOB *JOB**
10. After the request and load process has been completed, use the LSAM menu 9, option 1: Work with LSAM PTFs to view the new PTF information that has been loaded into the LSAM database for this LSAM environment.

#### Review PTF Status and Instructions
Whenever one or more PTFs has been requested and loaded to the LSAM PTF control database, the next step should be to examine the updated list of unapplied PTFs for the following exceptional conditions:

- PTFs that require LSAM down time for application

- PTFs that include post-install instructions

1. In the command line, enter **SMAGPL/STRSMA**. For more information on **STRSMA** command parameters, refer to the [STRSMA Command](../operations/lsam.md#the-strsma-command).
2. Enter **9** to choose the PTF and Security menu in the LSAM Main Menu.
3. Enter **1** to choose **Work with LSAM PTFs** in the PTF and Security Menu.
4. Press <**F15**> to display the Subset PTF List window in the Work with LSAM PTFs list display.
5. Type **1** in the **Select subset** field to limit the list to the un-applied PTFs only.
6. Press <**Enter**> to continue.
7. The **Work with LSAM PTFs** list reappears with a limited number of entries. If no entries appear, there are no new PTFs to be applied, and the process ends with this step.
8. Review the list for any lines that show a '1' under the column **Dwn**. If there are any entries in this column, then the operations schedule must be planned to accommodate LSAM server down time before proceeding with the step to apply the PTFs.
9. Review the list for any lines that show a '1' under the column **PIn**. If there are any entries in this column this means there are Post-Install Instructions that must be reviewed before the PTF application should be executed. Sometimes the "post-install" instructions could actually include some pre-install requirements. It might also be necessary to complete the post-install instruction of one PTF before attempting to apply any other PTFs. In this case, the cumulative PTF application procedure cannot be used and  individual PTF application must be performed instead, at least until the restricted PTF is applied. (After that, all remaining PTFs could be applied by the cumulative PTF application procedure outlined below.)
10. When planning down time for LSAM PTF application, as experience is gained with the PTF application tools, it is feasible to create jobs in an OpCon/xps schedule that will assure all other work is completed or suspended until LSAM PTF application that requires down time is completed. The LSAM PTF application can be executed by an OpCon/xps job that calls the command SMAPTFCUM (or SMAPTFAPY) with appropriate parameters. By setting the PTF options so that the LSAM server operations are automatically restarted, the OpCon/xps schedule will be notified as soon as the LSAM link is restored that the PTF application job has completed normally. At that point, normal OpCon/xps schedule operations for the LSAM may resume.

#### Apply Cumulative PTF (SMAPTFCUM)
Whenever one or more PTFs has been requested and loaded to the LSAM PTF control database, and the review of unapplied PTFs has been completed, the normal procedure would be to apply all unapplied PTFs in a single  step (as long as the PTF Post-install instructions present no obstacles). The individual PTF application process and the cumulative PTF application process are essentially similar.

1. Log on to an IBM i interactive workstation session as either QSECOFR or an LSAM Administrator with *ALLOBJ authority. Normally, PTF application is considered to require QSECOFR authority because any aspect of the LSAM software may require updating, and some LSAM features involve the management of authority assigned to QSECOFR.
2. In the command line, enter **SMAGPL/STRSMA**. For more information on **STRSMA** command parameters, refer to the [STRSMA Command](../operations/lsam.md#the-strsma-command).
3. Enter **9** to choose the PTF and Security menu in the LSAM Main Menu.
4. Enter **5** to choose **Apply cumulative PTF (SMAPTFCUM)** in the PTF and Security Menu.
5. The IBM command prompt for the SMAPTFCUM command appears.
6. In the SMAPTFCUM command prompt screen, if the current LSAM environment is not the default LSAM environment, change the **Environment name** to either *CURRENT or to the actual LSAM environment name. (The value *CURRENT cannot be used when the command SMAPTFCUM is executed in a batch job, unless the job's initial library list was set equal to the target LSAM environment library list.)
7. Leave the parameter **LSAM General Purpose Library** set to the value *DEFAULT. (This option is available mostly for SMA internal development and testing purposes.)
8. Press <**Enter**> to continue.
9. The PTF application process is performed automatically in the interactive job.
10. If requested, and the LSAM servers had to be suspended during the PTF application process, the LSAM servers are automatically restarted as soon as the PTF application process.
11. The cumulative PTF procedure completes by displaying a message on the workstation screen, "Cumulative PTF application to LSAM: <*LSAM_name*> completed normally."

#### Configuration for the "IFS" method of obtaining PTFs
When site firewall rules prohibit the direct connection of the IBM i partition to any outside server (by automatic means), change the PTF Configuration options to use the IFS method. This method supports manually storing the PTF save files (called LSCTLDTA and LSCUMPTF) into any IFS root directory, as binary stream files (with no suffix on the file name). Use a manual procedure, for example, to transfer the PTF save files to this IFS directory, after they have been manually
downloaded from SMA's client ftp server. Follow these steps to configure the LSAM PTF application tools for the IFS method:

1. From LSAM sub-menu **9**, enter **7** to choose **PTF options configuration**.
2. <**Tab**> to the following fields and type data for each:

    a.  In the **PTF source** field, type "IFS".
     
    b.  The **SMA ftp user** field, the **Password** and the **Confirm Pwrd** fields, and the **FTP URL or IP address** field, are not used by this method. They may be ignored. 

    c.  In the **Source directory or path** field, type the path name of the IFS directory that was created for this specific purpose. For example, if the IFS root directory is used/allowed, the path name might be '\SMA\IBMiLSAMptf\'. Note that the trailing slash character must be typed.

    d.  Press <**Enter**> to commit the changes to the LSAM Parameters control file.

3. Using this method, there will not be any data communications or ftp messages displayed during the first steps of loading the PTF save files into the SMAGPL library.
