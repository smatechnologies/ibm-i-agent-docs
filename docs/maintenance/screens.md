##### Menu Pathways

Main Menu \> PTF and Security menu (\#9)

##### Options

- As listed on menu example, above.
- The option 8. Work with object authority is described in LSAM
    Security and Object Authority.

##### Functions

- **F3=Exit**: Returns to the master menu.
- **F4=Prompt**: Prompts for keywords for any command entered in the
    Select or command line.
- **F9=Retrieve**: Retrieves the previous command that was entered on
    the Select or the command line. If it is pressed multiple times, the
    system goes further and further back to previous commands.
- **F12=Cancel**: Returns to the master menu.
- **F13=Information Assistant**: Branches to the IBM i general help
    screen.
- **F16=System main menu**: This is always shown on any
    system-generated menu screen. It branches to the general command
    entry menu for IBM i. Return to the previous menu by pressing
    \<**F3**\> or \<**F12**\>. This function is not commonly used and
    can be restricted for certain user profiles.

## PTF Options Configuration

- **Screen Title**: PTF Process Defaults Configuration
- **Screen ID**: LSAPTFD301

The PTF Options Configuration function must be reviewed and possibly
updated before attempting to use any of the other PTF functions in LSAM
Menu \# 9. The impact of the control values maintained by this function
is discussed above, among the operational guidance topics.

Special attention is called to the first data entry field on this
display: PTF Source. Although there are four different methods supported
for distributing and installing LSAM PTFs, most clients of SMA Technologies are using the "IFS" method because
it does not require penetration of firewalls protecting the IBM i
partition, and because this well-documented installation method is fast
and easy to use. However, sites that operate a large number of IBM i
partitions inside of a secured local network could take advantage of the
fully automated distribution and installation method that is supported
by the PTF source of "FTP."

##### Fields

| Field      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| PTF Source      | LSAM PTF installation files can be distributed and made available to the IBM i partition in four different ways. SMA Technologies recommends using the IFS method. Refer to "Options for PTF Distribution" in this section for an explanation of the requirements for using any of these options.
 -   FTP = LSAM PTF installation save files can be downloaded directly from an ftp server operated by SMA Technologies, as a first step in a fully automated solution for obtaining and then installing the LSAM PTFs. 
 -   OPT = On demand, SMA          |
|                                 |     Technologies can prepare an   |
|                                 |     optical disk that contains    |
|                                 |     the LSAM PTF save files. The  |
|                                 |     LSAM administrator would      |
|                                 |     insert the optical disk into  |
|                                 |     a drive that is attached to   |
|                                 |     the IBM i partition, before   |
|                                 |     starting the LSAM PTF         |
|                                 |     installation process.         |
|                                 | -   IFS = LSAM PTF installation   |
|                                 |     save files are manually       |
|                                 |     transferred by the LSAM       |

|                                 |     before starting the LSAM PTF  |
|                                 |     installation process.         |
|                                 | -   NTC = It is possible to       |
|                                 |     utilize the IBM i NetServer   |
|                                 |     service which enables a       |
|                                 |     connection between the IBM i  |
|                                 |     partition and directories     |
|                                 |     located on a Microsoft        |
|                                 |     Windows â„¢ server or personal  |
|                                 |     computer. For this method,    |
|                                 |     the LSAM PTF save files would |
|                                 |     first be transferred to a     |
|                                 |     designated MS Windows         |
|                                 |     location, and that location   |
|                                 |     would be entered into the     |
|                                 |     Source directory or path      |
|                                 |     field, before starting the    |

|                    |     utilities; usually SMAGPL (or its          |
|                    |     equivalent), some older sites had used     |
|                    |     QGPL to hold these LSAM tools              |
|                    | -   UTIL = the name of the SMAGPL library      |
|                    |     where the LSAM PTF tools are stored.       |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| PTF LVL            | There are three different patch levels listed  |

|                    |     SMA Support, when requested. This is the   |
|                    |     master patch level of the overall Agent    |
|                    |     software.                                  |
|                    | -   DB PTF LVL: This is the database level.    |
|                    |     This level controls when two LSAM          |
|                    |     environments match for the purpose of      |
|                    |     exchanging data using the LSAM Data        |
|                    |     Export/Import tools. Multiple PTFs will be |
|                    |     assigned at the same DB LVL.               |
|                    | -   UTIL PTF LVL: This less-critical value is  |
|                    |     useful for SMA Technical Support. It shows |
|                    |     which Agent software patches were applied  |
|                    |     affecting the content of the SMAGPL and    |
|                    |     UTIL libraries (explained in the Field row |

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| SMAGPL             | The name of the actual library used to store   |
|                    | the LSAM environment management utilities.     |
|                    | This may be the same as the utility library    |

| PTF Name           | The name of the PTF. This name is a key value  |
|                    | used for identification purposes only. It is   |
|                    | the name that will appear in the PTF Level     |
|                    | field for the LSAM Environment (and/or the     |
|                    | SMAGPL utility library).                       |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Seq Nbr            | The application order sequence number assigned |
|                    | to the PTF. This number controls the critical  |
|                    | order of application for PTFs and it helps     |
|                    | determine PTF dependencies.                    |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| PTF-lvl-DB         | Two list columns show the LSAM PTF Level and   |
|                    | the Database Level that is assigned to each    |
|                    | PTF in the list. The PTF Level is the critical |
|                    | level for indicating the overall patch level   |
|                    | of the software, but it is separate from the   |
|                    | PTF Name and the Sequence Number, where the    |
|                    | Sequence Number is used to control the order   |

|                    | post-install instructions before planning      |
|                    | their installation. It is possible that        |
|                    | certain PTFs require special attention and     |
|                    | cannot simply be applied as part of a          |
|                    | cumulative PTF application to a live LSAM      |

##### Options

- **4=Rollback**: Selects a PTF for rollback. When \<**Enter**\> is
    pressed, the LSAM PTF rollback command (SMAPTFRBK) prompt screen
    will appear, requesting additional information or verification of
    the rollback parameters. This option is the same as using the LSAM
    menu PTF rollback function.
- **5=Display**: Select a PTF record to view the full detailed profile
    of the PTF, including the long description. (Use option 7=Details to
    see a list of objects included in the PTF.)
- **6=Apply**: Selects a PTF for application. When \<**Enter**\> is
    pressed, the LSAM single PTF application command (SMAPTFAPY) prompt
    screen will appear, requesting additional information or
    verification of the application parameters. This option is the same
    as using the LSAM menu single PTF application function.
- **7=Details**: Select a PTF to view a list of the LSAM software
    objects affected by this PTF.
- **8=Instr**: If a PTF shows a '1' in the PIn column, option 8 may
    be used to view the PTF source file member that contains the
    post-install instructions text.

##### Functions

- **F3=Exit**: Quits the list display and returns to the menu. Any
    options already completed will still apply.
- **F5=Refresh**: Reload the display from the database file, clearing
    any pending options that were previously entered but not executed.
    This function key also resets any search rule that is in effect, but
    it does not reset the current subset rule.
- **F9=Print**: Print a report that shows all the PTFs currently
    selected by the subset rule that is in effect.
- **F11=Sort Seq\#/Name**: Use this function key to toggle between
    sorting the list by PTF Name, or by PTF Sequence Number. The heading
    line on the list uses a pink color to show which sort option is
    currently in effect.
- **F12=Cancel**: Quit the list display return to the menu without
    executing any remaining options that may have been entered. Options
    previously executed will still apply.
- **F15=Subset**: Change the current list subset rule, or clear
    subsetting to show all records. The current subset rule that is in
    effect is shown in the Subset field at the top, left of the list
    display. Refer to window description, below.
- **F16=Search next**: This function key or the \<**Enter**\> key may
    be used to start a search when a value has been entered in the
    Search content field, but only \<**F16**\> may be used to continue
    the search on to the next matching record after the first match has
    been found.
- **F17=Top**: Move the list display to the first record in the list.
- **F18=Bottom**: Move the list display to the last record in the
    list.
- **F21=Post inst**: Show a list of all available post-install
    instruction source members. NOTE: The IBM i SEU function is used to
    show the list of data members in the LSAM source physical file where
    post-install instructions are store, one member for each affected
    PTF Name. This SEU function appears to allow option 2=Edit to change
    the source members, and while clients may wish to use this access to
    add their own critical notes, SMA does not recommend changing the
    distributed instructions. SMA cannot be responsible for damage to
    the software or LSAM database that may result from altering the
    instructions.
- **F24=More keys**: Press this function key to toggle between lists
    of available function keys. All available function keys may be used,
    even when not shown.

| Field             | Description                                     |
+===================+=================================================+
| LSAM environment  | The name of the current LSAM environment;       |
|                   | governs the content of the list display.        |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| LSAM PTF LVL      | This is the master PTF Level control number     |
|                   | assigned to this PTF. Each PTF has a unique PTF |
|                   | Level assigned to it. This information is       |
|                   | global for the LSAM and not specific to the one |
|                   | PTF on display.                                 |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| DB LVL            | This is the database level that is assigned to  |
|                   | this PTF. Many PTFs may be applied at the same  |
|                   | database level. The DB LVL governs the LSAM     |
|                   | Data Export/Import tools, controlling when two  |
|                   | LSAM environments are matched and may exchange  |
|                   | data. This information is global for the LSAM   |
|                   | and not specific to the one PTF on display.     |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| SMAGPL/UTIL libs  | The third line of headings on this display      |
|                   | format starts with the names of the two         |
|                   | libraries that are used for the SMAGPL and UTIL |
|                   | purposes (as described in the Work with PTF     |
|                   | list display). These two logical locations are  |
|                   | usually assigned to the same library name. This |
|                   | information is global for the LSAM and not      |
|                   | specific to the one PTF on display.             |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| SMAGPL/UTIL LVL   | This is the highest PTF Level that was last     |
|                   | applied to the SMAGPL and UTIL library          |
|                   | location(s). The SMAGPL/UTIL PTF level may be   |
|                   | helpful to SMA Technical Support personnel.     |
|                   | This information is global for the LSAM and not |
|                   | specific to the one PTF on display.             |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| PTF Name / Seq \# | The identifying name of the PTF, followed by    |
|                   | the PTF sequence number that controls the       |
|                   | critical order of PTF application.              |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Issue date, time  | The date and time assigned to the PTF as it was |
|                   | issued. This information could be critical if   |
|                   | it ever becomes necessary for SMA to replace a  |
|                   | faulty PTF.                                     |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| LSAM PTF level    | The LSAM version to which the PTF applies,      |
|                   | e.g., 04.00.03. A PTF must match the current    |
|                   | LSAM version in order to be eligible for        |
|                   | application. The PTF list program filters and   |
|                   | includes only PTFs that match the current       |
|                   | version of the LSAM.                            |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| PTF apply pgm     | The name of a custom program provided by SMA to |
|                   | apply the PTF. If not blank, this program will  |
|                   | be used in place of the standard PTF            |
|                   | application routines that would normally apply  |
|                   | at PTF.                                         |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| PTF priority      | NOT USED. SMA may use this field in the future  |
|                   | to help control the priority of critical versus |
|                   | non-critical PTFs.                              |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Keywords 1, 2, 3  | NOT USED. SMA may add information to these      |
|                   | fields to enhance the search capability         |
|                   | available on the list display. Keywords are     |
|                   | useful for identifying PTFs that apply to a     |
|                   | particular LSAM feature or to an easily         |
|                   | recognized error message ID.                    |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| PTF save file     | The name of the save file used by SMA to        |
|                   | deliver the PTF replacement objects. The save   |
|                   | file names are normally limited to 8 characters |
|                   | so that they can be easily viewed, recognized   |
|                   | and automatically retrieved from optical media  |
|                   | (CD or DVD).                                    |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Rollback SAVF     | The name of the rollback save file that was     |
|                   | automatically generated by the LSAM PTF         |
|                   | application tool, used to store the old         |
|                   | versions of objects that were replaced by the   |
|                   | PTF. The rollback process uses this save file,  |
|                   | stored in the SMAPTF (or equivalent) library,   |
|                   | during the rollback process. (If a PTF is       |
|                   | re-applied, a secondary rollback save file is   |
|                   | generated, to preserve an accurate record of    |
|                   | system history. However, the original rollback  |
|                   | save file will always be used for a subsequent  |
|                   | repeated rollback procedure. SMA Support        |
|                   | personnel must assist if there is every a       |
|                   | reason to force the secondary rollback file to  |
|                   | be used instead of the original rollback file.) |

|                   |                                                 |
|                   | -   Current status: blank=not applied,          |
|                   |     A=applied, R=rolled back.                   |
|                   | -   Ever applied: If '1', the last applied    |
|                   |     date shows below this flag.                 |
|                   | -   RBK eligible: If not set to '1', a PTF    |
|                   |     may not be rolled back. This may imply that |
|                   |     any previous PTFs with dependencies on this |
|                   |     PTF may also not be rolled back. In an      |
|                   |     emergency, SMA Support assistance would be  |
|                   |     required to repair LSAM software if it      |
|                   |     appears that a not-eligible PTF has caused  |
|                   |     and problem. However, since the PTF is not  |
|                   |     eligible for rollback, the fix for any      |
|                   |     problem would normally be another PTF to    |
|                   |     fix the bad PTF.                            |
|                   | -   Ever rollback: If this field is set to      |
|                   |     '1', a last rollback date will appear     |
|                   |     below the flag. If a re-applied PTF must be |
|                   |     rolled back a second time, the setting of   |
|                   |     this flag at '1' would signal that a      |
|                   |     secondary rollback save file will be        |
|                   |     created.                                    |

| Down indicators   | -   These indicators help control the LSAM PTF  |
|                   |     tool automatic functions that stop and      |
|                   |     restart the various sub-groups of LSAM      |
|                   |     server jobs. The server jobs are arranged   |
|                   |     by groups so that, for example, it may not  |
|                   |     be necessary to stop job scheduling if only |
|                   |     the SMAFT server is affected.               |
|                   | -   The "Any function" flag is an overall     |
|                   |     indicator that also shows on the list of    |
|                   |     PTFs. This flag will be set to '1' if any |
|                   |     of the other LSAM server sub-group flags    |
|                   |     are set to '1'. If any PTF down time is   |
|                   |     required, an analysis of these detailed     |
|                   |     flags will help the site determine the      |
|                   |     impact and planning of the required down    |
|                   |     time.                                       |

|                   | of the LSAM software is affected by the PTF.    |
|                   | This information could be useful because it     |
|                   | would be found using the Search content         |

+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Environ           | The name of the LSAM environment that this PTF  |
|                   | control record is assigned to. Unapplied PTFs   |
|                   | will always show a value of "SMAGPL" in this  |
|                   | field; applied PTFs will show the name of the   |
|                   | current LSAM in this field.                     |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| PTF short desc    | The short description of a PTF that appears on  |

|                   | highlight critical information about a PTF.     |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| PTF long desc     | A longer description of the PTF that helps      |
|                   | understand what problem is fixed or what        |
|                   | enhancement is offered by a PTF.                |

##### Functions

- **F3=Exit**: Quits the PTF control record display and returns to the
    menu.
- **F6=(Re-)Apply**: If a PTF is at an eligible status, this function
    key is the same as option 6=Apply on the list display. After a
    dependency check, a prompt screen will appear for the command
    SMAAPYPTF.
- **F7=Details**: Branches to a display of all the objects affected by
    this PTF.
- **F11=Rollback PTF**: If a PTF is at an eligible status, this
    function key is the same as option 4=rollback on the PTF list
    display. After a dependency check, a prompt screen will appear for
    the command SMAPTFRBK.
- **F12=Cancel**: Return to the PTF list display.
- **F21=Post inst**: If the PTF is marked as having post-install
    instructions, this function key appears and supports a branch to the
    IBM i SEU utility display of the text of the post-install
    instructions source member.
- **F22=Find conflicts**: This function key may be used to discover
    any PTFs that would conflict with the current PTF's next possible
    operation. If a PTF is unapplied or rolled back, the conflicts would
    be for any prior PTFs that are required. If a PTF is applied, then
    the conflicts would be for any future PTF already applied that would
    prevent a rollback.
- **F24=More keys**: Toggle the function key legend to show other
    supported function keys.

## Option 7/Function Key7=Details

- **Screen Title**: Details List for PTF ptfname
- **Screen ID**: LSAPTFR3

The list of all objects affected by a PTF supports an important option
that will list all PTFs affecting the object selected with option 9. The
list shown for option 9 is the same as the primary list of PTFs, except
that the title line indicates it is a list of PTFs for just one object.

|                            | type, such as \*PGM or \*FILE.         |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Object attribute           | The IBM i mnemonic for the object      |
|                            | type, such as CLLE or RPGLE for type   |
|                            | \*PGM.                                 |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| CCSID of data objects      | If applicable, the character set ID    |
|                            | assigned to a database file or data    |
|                            | area.                                  |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Duplicate data             | For database files, indicates that the |
|                            | file sent from SMA contains control    |
|                            | data that is normally distributed to   |
|                            | client installations.                  |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Data convert program       | When not blank, names a specialty      |
|                            | program that must be called at the     |
|                            | time an object is replaced by the PTF. |
|                            | For database files, this program would |
|                            | be used instead of the default CPYF    |
|                            | operation typically used to retain and |
|                            | convert existing client data.          |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Original apply time        | The system time stamp when the PTF was |
|                            | first applied to this LSAM environment |
|                            | (or to the SMAGPL utility library).    |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Apply seq                  | The critical application sequence      |
|                            | number assigned to each object         |
|                            | affected by a PTF. Application         |
|                            | sequence is especially critical, for   |
|                            | example, to properly convert physical  |
|                            | files and the logical files that       |
|                            | depend on them. Out of sequence, file  |
|                            | management could cause the PTF         |
|                            | application process to fail.           |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Rollback/Reapply times     | Two time stamp fields that record when |
|                            | the Rollback and/or the Re-apply       |
|                            | actions were last executed.            |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Record write/update        | SMA internal use, identifies when the  |
|                            | PTF object control record was last     |
|                            | updated. This information could be     |
|                            | important if it becomes necessary to   |
|                            | replace a faulty PTF.                  |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Prim key                   | For use by technical support personnel |
|                            | only, this is the primary key of the   |
|                            | object record in the PTF details       |
|                            | master file.                           |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| IFS object name            | When the disk location is IFS, this is |
|                            | the name of the object.                |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| IFS directory path         | When the disk location is IFS, this is |
|                            | the directory where the object will be |
|                            | replaced. (The PTF applications tools  |
|                            | will handle any path replacement       |
|                            | required when an alternate LSAM        |
|                            | environment is being used.)            |

##### Functions

- **F3=Exit**: Quits the detail display and returns to the menu.
- **F11=View PTF ID**: Branches to a display of the PTF control
    information for the PTF controlling this object.
- **F12=Cancel**: Quit the detail display and return to the list
    display and return the list of PTF objects.
- **F20=Show all PTFs for Obj**: The same as option 9=All PTFs from
    the object list display, this function key branches to a list of all
    PTFs that affect this object. The PTF list display is the same as
    the Work with LSAM PTFs list, documented above, except that the
    title line will show the name of the reference Object whose PTFs are
    being listed.

#### PTF Request and Application Menu Functions

The following menu functions result in a display of a prompted IBM i
command parameters screen for each of the LSAM commands listed on the
menu:

2.[ Master PTF request, load and apply (SMAPTFINS)]{style="color: #008000;"}

3.[ Request PTF information or save files (SMAPTFREQ)]{style="color: #008000;"}

4.[ Load PTF information or save files (SMAPTFLOD)]{style="color: #008000;"}

5.[ Apply cumulative PTF (SMAPTFCUM)]{style="color: #008000;"}
6.[ Apply single PTF (SMAPTFAPY)]{style="color: #008000;"}

Typically, these command prompting functions are followed by a
program-formatted display of the process control information. This
second display appears to contain most of the same information as the
command prompt, but the display shows how any command parameter default
values (such as when asterisk (\*) is specified) were resolved by
referring to the LSAM PTF options configuration control data. Final
changes may be made on these secondary displays, if necessary, before
the operation is committed to execution.

The contents of the PTF process control fields are explained in detail
above, under the topic of How to obtain and apply PTFs. Also refer to
the Screens and Windows description of the PTF options configuration,
LSAM menu 9, option 7. In other cases, the information requested by
commands, such as the SMAPTFAPY command to apply just one PTF at a time,
must be obtained from the detail record displays accessed from Work with
LSAM PTFs (LSAM menu 9, option 1).
