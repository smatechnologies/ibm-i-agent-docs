# Additional Information for OR Scripts

## Cursor Control Strings
| String | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Backspace | Moves the cursor one column to the left, erasing a character (destructive backspace).|
|           | **Note**: Backspace must be contained within the confines of a single input-capable field. Attempting to use Backspace to move left from the first column of an input-capable field generates an error (use Cursor Left to accomplish a move to the left outside of a field definition). |
| Cursor Down | Moves the cursor down one row. When the cursor starts from the lowest row of the screen size, the cursor wraps to the same column position in row 1.
| Cursor Left | Moves the cursor one column to the left (without erasing a character like backspace would do). When the cursor starts from column 1, it wraps to the last column of the previous row. From row 1, column 1, the cursor wraps to the last column of the lowest row. 
| Cursor Right | Moves the cursor one column to the right. From the highest column number on a row, the cursor wraps to the first column of the next row. From the last column of the last row, the cursor wraps to row 1, column 1.
| Cursor Up | Moves the cursor up one row. When the cursor starts from row 1, it wraps to the same column position in the lowest row defined for the screen.
| Field Advance | Causes the cursor to move to the first column of the next input-capable field defined for a screen.
| Field Backspace | Causes the cursor to move to the first column of the previous input-capable field defined for a screen.
| Field Exit | Causes the cursor to move to the first column of the next input-capable field defined for a screen, while also clearing any data from the cursor start position to the end of the input-capable field that is being exited.
| New Line | Positions the cursor to the first column of the first input-capable field on a row below the starting location of the cursor. When the cursor starts from the lowest row that has an input-capable field, the cursor wraps to the first column of the first input-capable field from the top of the screen.

## Functions to Send
| Function Key | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| ACK | The special function key value ACK does not generate any data sent to the Host system. It is used to clear the script driver program's screen image buffer, typically after a *STATUS message was received from the host. Status messages do not require any response by a human operator, but the Script driver program must clear them from the program's buffer in order to manage step timeouts and recognize the next display format write that would require a response. |
| ATTN | Sends an interrogative Attention signal to the display manager program in IBM i, causing whatever response has been defined for the Attention key. The Attention key usually suspends the screen dialog that was in progress. It interrupts screen dialog by presenting another screen's format that would not have been part of the defined dialog. Attention keys have a default action provided by IBM i (typically presenting a menu of options), but they may be changed using system control values and job attributes. They may also be overridden within a specific job by using the SETATNPGM command within that job. |
|      |  **Note**: SETATNPGM only takes effect for programs at, or lower in the invocation stack than the level where the command is issued. If the program returns to a higher level in the invocation stack, the system or job default setting for the attention key takes effect and the setting performed by the SETATNPGM command is abandoned. |
| ENTER | The default keyboard action that causes the input buffer contents to be returned to the IBM i program, usually without requesting any other special function. |
|       | **Note**: The action caused by the following function keys (F1-F24) may vary, depending on how the IBM i display format was  defined: User-created display formats can specify whether each function key returns the input buffer contents along with the function key command, or just return the function key command without returning any data that might have been entered by the display user (or display user intercept program). Some typical assignments that are made into function keys, such as by IBM i command entry/prompt screens, are listed in Function Keys. |
| F1 | Command/function key F1 (aid byte hexadecimal value '31')
| F2 | Command/function key F2 (aid byte hexadecimal value '3C')
| F3 | Command/function key F3 (aid byte hexadecimal value '31')
| F4 | Command/function key F4 (aid byte hexadecimal value '32')
| F5 | Command/function key F5 (aid byte hexadecimal value '33')
| F6 | Command/function key F6 (aid byte hexadecimal value '34')
| F7 | Command/function key F7 (aid byte hexadecimal value '35')
| F8 | Command/function key F8 (aid byte hexadecimal value '36')
| F9 | Command/function key F9 (aid byte hexadecimal value '37')
| F10 | Command/function key F10 (aid byte hexadecimal value '38')
| F11 | Command/function key F11 (aid byte hexadecimal value '39')
| F12 | Command/function key F12 (aid byte hexadecimal value '3A')
| F13 | Command/function key F13 (aid byte hexadecimal value '3B')
| F14 | Command/function key F14 (aid byte hexadecimal value '3C')
| F15 | Command/function key F15 (aid byte hexadecimal value 'B1')
| F16 | Command/function key F16 (aid byte hexadecimal value 'B2')
| F17 | Command/function key F17 (aid byte hexadecimal value 'B3')
| F18 | Command/function key F18 (aid byte hexadecimal value 'B6')
| F19 | Command/function key F19 (aid byte hexadecimal value 'B7')
| F20 | Command/function key F20 (aid byte hexadecimal value 'B8')
| F21 | Command/function key F21 (aid byte hexadecimal value 'B9')
| F22 | Command/function key F22 (aid byte hexadecimal value 'BA')
| F23 | Command/function key F23 (aid byte hexadecimal value 'BB')
| F24 | Command/function key F24 (aid byte hexadecimal value 'BC')
| HOME | The Home function key may be user-assigned to a specific location on the screen, or it may return the cursor to the first column of the first input-capable field on the screen.
| PAGEDN | Page Down (formerly known as Scroll Up) requests that the screen host program (or the system function that manages a display subfile) present the next available page of information available for a list that is on the screen (aid byte hexadecimal value 'F5'). |
|        | If Page Down is returned when the end of a list is already on the display, there may be a non-fatal error message returned.          |
| PAGEUP | Page Up (formerly known as Scroll Down) requests that the screen host program (or the system function that manages a display subfile) present the previous available page of information available for a list that is on the screen (aid byte hexadecimal value 'F4'). |
|        | If Page Up is returned when the beginning of a list is already on the display, there may be a non-fatal error message returned. |
| RESET  | This special function instructs the IBM i display manager to reset from an error condition that has previously set the input-inhibited indicator along with the screen error indicator (a low-level 5250 device status instruction). This function key has no effect and does not generate an error if the screen is not in a reset able condition. It should only be issued when the appropriate circumstances have been detected. Reset has no effect if the input-inhibited indicator has been set during the wait period after <**Enter**> or another function key has been used to return control of the screen to the IBM i display manager (and/or the program that presented the screen). |
